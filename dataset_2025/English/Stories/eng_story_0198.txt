Ramu is a balloon man. He sells
balloons. He goes from house to house
everyday. One morning he went to a
village to sell his colourful balloons.
He called Raju, Bala, Mona, Saif and
Sonu and said “I have red, blue, green,
orange, yellow and white balloons. Do
you want to buy them?” But no one
bought them. He was very sad.
A young man came to him and
said,“ What’s
the matter?
You look sad.”
The balloon seller said, “ Yes. I’m
here to sell the balloons but no
one is buying them today. “Don’t
worry. I have come to buy them
and I want all the balloons.” The
young man bought all the
balloons. Then he gave them to the
children. The children were very
happy. This young man was
‘Chacha Nehru’.

Once in a beautiful garden, there grew a proud rose. She was beautiful and knew it, often boasting about her beauty to the other plants. “Look at my red petals, none of you are as beautiful as me,” she would say. This made the other plants feel sad.

One day, a little bird came to the garden and saw the rose. “Why do you boast so much?” asked the bird. “Everyone here is beautiful in their own way.” But the rose just scoffed at the bird.

As time passed, the seasons changed, and the rose began to wilt. Her petals started to fall off. She saw the other plants helping each other, sharing water and nutrients from the soil. The rose felt lonely and realized her mistake.

When spring came, the rose had only one petal left. She apologized to the other plants for her pride. The plants forgave her and helped her grow again.

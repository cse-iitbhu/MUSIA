There were four friends — Circle, Square, Triangle
and Rectangle. One day there began a fight between
the friends. Each of them said they were the best.
Circle said, “I am
the best! I am round
and beautiful. I have no
sharp edges. Children
use me to draw a smiling
face. There are so many
beautiful things in my
shape. I am the best!”
The other shapes
refused to agree with
the circle. Square then
said, “I am the best!
I have four sides and
all of them are equal
in size. Children eat
many sweets which are
square in shape. I look
very beautiful and so I
am the best.”
After listening to this, Triangle
said in a loud voice, “I am the best!
Just look at me! I am so beautiful.
I have three sides. Children use
me to draw mountains. They
enjoy many yummy snacks in my
shape. So, I am the best!” 
Listening to the other three friends,
Rectangle laughed aloud. “Of course
not. No one can be better than me.
I have four sides. Two are equally long
and two are equally short. I look so
beautiful. Children enjoy biscuits and
chocolates in rectangle shape. They
also use so many things in my shape.
I am the best!” said the rectangle.
The friends could not decide who was the best
among them. They decided to ask the first person
they meet.
After some time, they met a star. They stopped
her and told her of their fight. They asked her to
decide who was the best among them.
The star was wise. She looked at all of them.
She thought for a while. Then she said, “All of you
are friends. Then why should you fight? Let me
tell you something very important. Do you know
what you could do if you were together? You could
create the most beautiful pictures and patterns!
Just look around. We find amazing designs and
things in all the shapes. So, stop fighting. Together
we all can create wonders.”
The friends realised their mistake and promised
each other that they would never fight again. They
remained best friends forever

ONCE upon a time, in a faraway
country, there lived a mother who had
two daughters. One was her own child,
the other was her stepdaughter. She
was very fond of her own daughter, but
she hated her stepdaughter. The
only reason was that Marouckla, the
stepdaughter, was prettier than her own
daughter, Holena.
The gentle-hearted Marouckla did
not know how beautiful she was, and
so she could never make out why her
mother was always so cross with her.
Marouckla had to do all the
housework, tidying up the cottage,
cooking, washing, spinning, weaving
and sewing. She liked work and she did
it all without a word of complaint while
Holena spent the time adorning herself
and lazing about. Even then, Holena
and her mother scolded and rated and
abused Marouckla every day. They
envied her so much that one day, they
decided to throw her out in the freezing
cold to get rid of her.
“Go, Marouckla, and get me some
violets from the forest; I want to wear
them and to smell them,” said Holena.
“But, my dear sister, it is impossible
to find violets in the snow,” said poor
Marouckla.
“How dare you argue when I tell you
to do something? Off you go at once,
and if you don’t bring me violets from
the forest I’ll kill you!” said Holena
threateningly.


The stepmother caught
hold of Marouckla,
turned her out of the door, and
slammed it to after her.
Marouckla went into the forest
weeping bitterly. The snow lay deep,
and there wasn’t a human footprint to
be seen. Marouckla wandered about
for a long time, tortured by hunger and
trembling with cold.
At last, she saw a light in the
distance. She went towards the glow,
which came from the top of a mountain.
A big fire was burning there, and round
the fire were twelve stones with twelve
men sitting on them. Three of them had
snow-white beards, three were not so
old, and three were still younger. The
three youngest were the handsomest of
them all. They were not speaking, but
all sitting silent. These twelve men were
the twelve months. Great January sat
highest of all; his hair and beard were
as white as snow, and in his hand he
held a club.
Marouckla was frightened. She
stood still for a time in terror, but,
growing bolder, she went up to them and
said, “Please, kind sirs, let me warm my
hands at your fire.”
Great January nodded, and asked
her, “Why have you come here, my dear
little girl ? What are you looking for ?”
“I am looking for violets,” answered
Marouckla.
“This is no time to be looking for
violets, for everything is covered with snow,” answered Great January.
“Yes, I know; but my sister Holena
and my stepmother said that I must
bring them some violets from the forest.
If I don’t bring them, they’ll kill me.
Tell me, fathers, please tell me where I
can find them.”
Great January stood up and went
to one of the younger months - it was
March - and, giving him the club, he
said, “Brother, take the high seat.”

March took the high seat upon the
stone and waved the club over the fire.
The fire blazed up, the snow began to
melt, the trees began to bud, and the
ground was at once covered with grass.
It was springtime.
The violets began to bloom among
their little leaves, and before Marouckla
had time to think, so many of them had
sprung up that they looked like a blue
cloth spread out on the ground.

“Now, pick them
quickly, Marouckla!”
commanded March.
Marouckla picked them
joyfully till she had a big
bunch. Then she thanked the
months with all her heart and scampered
merrily home.
Holena and the stepmother
wondered when they saw Marouckla
bringing the violets. They opened the
door to her, and the scent of violets
filled all the cottage.
“Where did you get them?” asked
Holena sulkily.
“They are growing under the bushes
in a forest on the high mountains.”
Holena snatched all the flowers
and did not give even a single one to
her sister.
The next day, she called to her sister
and said, “Go, Marouckla, and get me
some strawberries from the forest.”
“Alas! dear sister, where could
I find any strawberries in this hard
winter ?” said Marouckla.
“How dare you argue ! Go at once
and get me the strawberries, or I’ll kill
you!”
The stepmother caught hold of
Marouckla and pushed her out of the
door and shut it after her.
Marouckla went to the forest
weeping bitterly. The snow was lying
deep, and there wasn’t a human footprint to be seen anywhere. She
wandered about for a long time, tortured
by hunger and trembling with cold. At
last, she saw the light she had seen the
other day. Overjoyed, she went towards
it. She came to the great fire with the
twelve months sitting round it.
“Please, kind sirs, let me warm my
hands at the fire.”
Great January nodded, and asked
her, “Why have you come again, and
what are you looking for here ?”
“I am looking for strawberries. My
sister Holena and my stepmother bade
me bring some strawberries, and if I
don’t, they will kill me. Tell me, fathers,
tell me, please, where I can find them.”
Great January arose. He went over
to the month sitting opposite to him - it
was June - and handed the club to him,
saying, “Brother, take the high seat.”
June took the high seat upon the
stone and swung the club over the fire.
The fire shot up, and its heat melted
the snow in a moment. The ground was
all green, the trees were covered with
leaves, the birds began to sing, and the
forest was filled with all kinds of flowers.
It was summer. The ground under the
bushes was covered with white starlets,
the starry blossoms were turning into
strawberries every minute. They ripened
at once, and before Marouckla had time
to think, there were so many of them
that it looked as though a red carpet had
been spread on the ground.
“Pick them at once, Marouckla !”
commanded June.

Marouckla picked them joyfully till
she had filled her apron full. Then she
thanked the months with all her heart
and scampered merrily home.
Holena and the stepmother
wondered when they saw Marouckla
bringing the strawberries. Her apron
was full of them.
“Where did you pick them?” asked
Holena sulkily.
“There are plenty of them growing
in the forest on the high mountains.”
Holena took all the strawberries,
and ate them all up with her mother.
They didn’t leave even a single one for
Marouckla.
On the third day, Holena ordered,
“Marouckla, go into the forest and get
me some red apples.”
The stepmother caught hold of
Marouckla and without giving her a
chance to speak, pushed her out of the
door and shut it after her.
Marouckla went to the forest again,
weeping bitterly. But she didn’t wander
about this time. She ran straight to the top of the mountain where the big fire
was burning and the twelve months
were sitting round the fire.
“Please, kind sirs, help me.”
Great January nodded, and asked
her, “What are you looking for today?”
“I am looking for red apples. If
I don’t bring them, my sister and my
mother will kill me. Tell me, father, tell
me, please, where I could find them.”
Great January rose up. He went
over to one of the older months - it was
September. He handed the club to him
and said, “Brother, take the high seat.”
Month September took the high seat
upon the stone and swung the club over
the fire. The fire began to burn with
a red flame, the snow began to melt.
But there was a cold wind that sent the
faded leaves down to the ground. It
was autumn. Marouckla saw just one
apple-tree with red apples hanging high
among its branches.
“Shake the tree at once,
Marouckla !” commanded September.
Right gladly Marouckla shook the

tree, and first one apple fell down and
then another.
“Now, Marouckla, that’s enough.
Run home quickly !” shouted the
months.
Marouckla obeyed at once. She
picked up the apples, thanked the
months with all her heart, and ran
merrily home.
Holena and the stepmother
wondered when they saw Marouckla
bringing the two apples.
“Where did you get them?” asked
Holena.
“I found them in the forest on the
high mountain.”
“And why didn’t you bring more ?
Or did you eat them on the way
home ?” said Holena harshly.
“Alas! sister dear, I haven’t even
tasted them. I shook the tree twice;
two apples fell down, and they wouldn’t
let me shake the tree again. They
shouted to me to go straight home,”
protested Marouckla.
“May you be struck to death by
lightning!” said the wicked Holena
and began to eat the apple. It tasted
so delicious that she told her mother
she had never tasted anything so nice
in all her life. The stepmother liked
it too. When they had finished, they
wanted some more.
“Mother, give me my fur coat.
Let’s go to the forest ourselves and get
the apples. That ragged little wretch way home. We’ll find the place all
right, and I’ll shake them all down,
however they shout at me.”
Her mother agreed readily. They
wrapped themselves in fur coats and
shawls and off they went to the forest.
The snow lay deep, and they
wandered about for a long time,
but at last they saw the top of the
mountain where the big fire was burning
and the twelve months were sitting.
They stepped up to the fire and
stretched out their hands to warm
them, without asking permission or
speaking one polite word.
“Why have you come here, and
what are you looking for ?” asked
Great January crossly.
“Why do you want to know,
you old fool ?” replied Holena angrily.
“It’s no business of yours,” said her
mother.
Great January frowned and
swung the club over his head. The
sky grew dark in a moment, the fire
burned low, the snow began to fall
thick and an icy wind began to blow
through the forest. Holena and her
mother couldn’t see one step in front of
them.
 They tried to find their way out but
the snow fell in huge masses, and soon,
they were lost in it.
At home, Marouckla waited and
waited and yet Holena and her mother
did not come back. When she went to search for them she found neither
her mother and sister nor the twelve
months in the forest. At last, she
returned home sadly. So, good Marouckla inherited
the cottage and the land around it.
She married a kind husband and
they both lived happily ever after.

A lamb was grazing with a flock of sheep one day. She soon found
some sweet grass at the edge of the field. Farther and farther she went,
away from the others.
She was enjoying herself so much that she did not notice a wolf
coming nearer to her. However, when it pounced on her, she was quick
to start pleading, “Please, please don’t eat me yet. My stomach is full of
grass. If you wait a while, I will taste much better.”
The wolf thought that was a good idea, so he sat down and waited.
After a while, the lamb said, “If you allow me to dance, the grass in my
stomach will be digested faster.” Again the wolf agreed.
While the lamb was dancing, she had a new idea. She said,
“Please take the bell from around my neck. If you ring it as hard as you
can, I will be able to dance even faster.”
The wolf took the bell and rang it as hard as he could. The shepherd heard the bell ringing and
quickly sent his dogs to find the missing lamb. The barking dogs frightened the wolf away and
saved the lamb’s life.

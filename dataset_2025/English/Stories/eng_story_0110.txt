Meena walked towards the stream
near the bamboo bridge. She bent
a little and put a paper boat in the
water. It sailed down the stream
swiftly. Meena was delighted.
She went on putting several
paper boats in the
stream.
As the boats floated down the stream, she saw
a naughty boy pushing the boats into the water.
Meena stared at the boy angrily. He did not care
for Meena’s angry face. She shouted “Stop!” But
the boy did not stop. 
“Why are you overturning the paper boats?”
Meena asked angrily.
“Because it is fun,” replied the boy.
“It may be fun for you, but those are my paper
boats” said Meena. “So, you just stop overturning
my boats.”
The boy thought for a minute and said, “I will
not do it again, but I also want to play. Can you
help me?”
Meena said, “I have enough paper. You can make
boats for yourself.” 
The boy answered, “I don’t know how to fold the
paper to make boats.”
Meena said, “That’s easy, I will help you.” She
showed him how to make the boats.
Meena took out coloured paper of different
sizes. She showed the boy how to fold and re-fold
the paper to make a boat. The boy watched
carefully. Then he took a piece of paper and
started to make a paper boat. Soon a few boats
were ready.
Meena gently put her boats in the stream. The
boy put his boats in the stream too. The boats sailed
down the stream. Both enjoyed watching the boats.

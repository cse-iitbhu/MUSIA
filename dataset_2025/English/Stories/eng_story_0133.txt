Dear Children,
Namaste! How are you all? I’m sure you are happy and
safe, and enjoying school. Some of you reach school on
foot, some by bicycle and others by bus.
You may have noticed that there is often
a lot of traffic on roads. Roads can be busy
and, at times, dangerous. We, the traffic
police, are here to keep you safe on the roads. So, we
want to share some important safety tips to help you
stay safe while walking on, or crossing, the streets.
By following these simple rules, you can keep yourself
safe and help us keep the roads accident-free. Let’s work
together to make our roads safer for everyone.
Stay safe & be careful,
With Best Wishes,
The Traffic Police
BharatWhen you need to cross the
road, look for a black and white
strip which is known as “Zebra
Crossing”. Look right, then left,
again right to ensure that no
vehicles are coming. Cross only
when it’s safe.
Footpaths are meant for
pedestrians. Always walk on
them and stay away from
moving vehicles.
Traffic lights are installed on
very busy roads to regulate
movement. Wait for the
pedestrian signal to turn green
before crossing. Never run
across the road. It’s safer to
walk calmly!
If you are walking near the
road, always hold an adult’s
hand, especially while crossing
the roadIf you are walking on a road
in the evening, stick some
reflective stickers on your
clothes, so that the drivers can
see you clearlyDo not play or get distracted
near roads. Also, avoid using
headphones or mobile phones
while walking near traffic. These
can distract you from traffic
sounds

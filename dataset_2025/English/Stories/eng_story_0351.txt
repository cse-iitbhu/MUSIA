The Golden Egg
Once upon a time, a farmer had a goose that laid a golden egg every day. The farmer used to sell that egg and earn enough money to meet their family's day-to-day needs. One day, the farmer thought that if he could get more such golden eggs and make a lot of money and become a wealthy person. He decided to wait patiently every day for the goose to lay more golden eggs. But day after day, the goose only laid one golden egg and the farmer grew impatient. Angry and frustrated, the farmer decided to cut open the goose, hoping to find all the golden eggs inside. To his disappointment, there were no golden eggs inside the goose. He had killed the goose that gave him the golden egg every day. The farmer realized that his impatience had cost him dearly. He learned the importance of being patient and grateful for what he already had.

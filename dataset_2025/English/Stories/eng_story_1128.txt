It was Sunday morning. Sunny was in his bed.
“ Get up Sunny, brush your teeth”,
 said his mother.
“ Hi Sunny, you are still lying in bed. Get
 up, ” said Mini.
“ Hi Mini, let’s play.”

“ But you look so dirty. I am clean.”
“ So what? Let’s play Mini.”

“ Come on Sunny, look yourself in the mirror.”
“ Ok. I will”.

“ Your teeth are yellow. Your mouth is
 sticky. Your hair are messy.”
“ Yes, I am looking very ugly.”

“ I like clean friends. Clean yourself and
 let’s go to play.”
“ Yes, I will be right back.”

“ Wow, Sunny you are looking neat and tidy. Let’s play.”
“ Thank you, Mini. Let’s play and enjoy Sunday.”
Mini and Sunny are playing with each other.

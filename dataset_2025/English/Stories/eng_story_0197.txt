WIND: Sun, can you
see that man walking
down the road? I can get
his coat off more quickly
than you can!
SUN (smiling): We
will see who is stronger.
I will let you try first.
WIND (puffing his
cheeks and blowing
hard): Whooooooooh…
whoooooooooooh! Whoooooooooh...
MAN: How strong
the wind is today! It is
blowing my coat away! I
must hold it tightly
round myself.
WIND (blowing harder) : Whooooooooh…
whoooooooooooooo !MAN (pulling his coat
more tightly): How cold it
is!
WIND: Sun, I give up.
I cannot get his coat off !
SUN: Now it is my
turn.
Let me try. (He
shines hard.) MAN: What
a funny day!
It was so cold and
now it is so hot!
SUN (shining harder): I will
make him feel
hotter and hotter.
MAN (wiping his
face): I must take off
my coat!
SUN: Wind, I have
won. I have made him
take off his coat!

Once upon a time, an old carpenter bought a very
queer piece of wood. As he used his
plane on it, he heard a little
laughing voice say, “Stop!
You’re tickling me.”
The old man was
puzzled by the voice.
He said, “This
is a strange piece
of wood. What
shall I do with it?
I think I’ll make
it into a puppet.”
He set to
work, and as
the puppet
boy took
shape, the old man said, “He must have a name.
I will call him Pinocchio.”
As soon as he finished making the eyes, the
carpenter was amazed to see them move.
Before the mouth was made, it began to laugh.
“Stop laughing!” the old man said.
It did stop,
but as soon as
his back was
turned, it put
out its tongue.
And its nose
grew long.
No sooner
were its hands
ready than it
snatched off
the carpenter’s wig and put it on its own head. And then
Pinocchio’s nose grew longer.
When its legs and feet were made, they were too stiff to
use, so the carpenter showed Pinocchio how to use them.
Now, the
carpenter decided
to send Pinocchio
to school. But
there, Pinocchio
did nothing but
look for fun. He
often ran away from
school.
“Why
don’t yougo to school?” asked the carpenter. Pinocchio told
him a lie... and his nose started growing longer
and longer.
Each time he was rude to someone or told a
lie, his nose grew longer. Finally Pinocchio said,
“I’m glad to be a real boy. I’ll never lie again.”

Everyone enjoys a holiday. So,
one fine Sunday, the Sun also took
a holiday. It suddenly disappeared
from the sky. Darkness covered the
earth.
A squirrel was chasing its
friend. It stopped and wondered
at the darkness. It guessed something
was wrong and ran home. A little
plant searched for the Sun. It couldn’t
grow without the Sun’s rays. Flowers
and leaves of the plant bent low to
the ground. Other trees also missed
the Sun. Mother bird peeped out of
her nest and whispered to its little
ones about the darkness. She was sad
because she couldn’t go out to find food
for them. The bee couldn’t find any honeybecause the flowers didn’t bloom,
so it went back to its hive. The Sun
wasn’t there, so the wind got stuck
up the hill.
Men, women and children stopped
working. They opened their windows and
said, “What happened to the Sun?” It was
very quiet every where and the warmth of
the Sun was missing too. All of them prayed
for the Sun to rise.
The Sun looked down from its abode. The stillness on the earth shocked
the Sun. The Sun felt sorry. The earth seemed lifeless. This made the Sun very
sad. So he decided to stop his holiday and start shining again.The plants grew and flowers bloomed. Bees and birds started singing.
The river flowed joyfully and the wind blew. Mother bird was happy and everyone
on the earth began to work!
Indeed, the Sun can never go on a holiday!

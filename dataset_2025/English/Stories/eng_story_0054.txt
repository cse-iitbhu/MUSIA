One night, Lion is getting ready for bed. He reads his favorite bedtime story and sings his favorite bedtime song. He turns on his night-light. Then — he hears a sound... 
Tap! … Tap!

"What’s that sound?” he whispers.
Tap! … Tap!
"That sound… it’s coming from outside the window!”  

He climbs out of bed. He grabs a baseball bat and tip-toes towards the window.
Tappity-tap! TAP!

“It’s a monster!” he thinks. He grabs his bicycle helmet and puts it on his head for protection. He hears the sound again...
TAP! ... TAP! … Tappity-TAP!

Lion panics. “The monster is getting closer! It sounds like the BIGGEST, SCARIEST monster ever!”

Tap! Tap! Tappity-tap!
TAPPITY-TAP!
TAPPITY-TAPPITY-TAPPITY…. TAP! 

"EEEK!" Lion squeals. He runs away from the window and hides under the bed. He pulls a blanket over his head. He holds his baseball bat tightly in his hands, and….

Tappity tap!

‍
A little frog jumps up on the window sill. The frog is wearing a tutu and tap shoes. She dances a little dance.
Tap tap tappity-tap!

"Hello Lion! Are you in there?” says the frog.

She looks through the window and sees Lion hiding under the bed. Lion is wrapped in a blanket… wearing a bicycle helmet … and holding a baseball bat. He looks ridiculous. 

(And to be honest, he feels ridiculous too.)

 "Ummm… I have some new dance moves to show you," says the frog.  "But you look busy. I will come back later. See ya!"

 The frog hops down to the ground and happily dances away.

‍Tap-TAP! Tappity-tappity-TAP!

Timmy Taps the Change
Once upon a bonny day, in a town not far away, there lived a little lad named Timmy the Tapper. He wore a blue cap and trew the best apple tap dances in the park after dark. Timmy's toes went tap-tap-tappity, but his fingers liked a sneaky-snatchity. You see, Timmy had a tiny little secret: he was a thief (a tiny little thief!). Timmy didn't steal big things, no sirreeÑjust wee things like shiny stones, twirls from ice cream cones, and sometimes even the town's jolly jubilee tones. One dim and drizzley day, a great grey goose sauntered into town. "Honkity-honk!" it blared, scaring townsfolk square. The townspeople hid and huddled, sure to keep cover from the goose's ruddled. But Timmy, with his brave blue cap, tip-toe-tapped towards that honking chap. "Shoo, you mighty goose!" Timmy shouted, bolder than a two-legged clover. But the goose remained with a honky-over. Timmy had an epiphany, that goose needed a friend! He used his tap shoes to clang and clang like a band in a parade. The goose just needed a music brigade! With a swoop and a loop, the goose joined the dance! Her webbed feet went flap-flap, creating quite the grand prance. Townsfolk peeked from their doors, as wonder sparkled upon floors. Generous giggles and claps filled the air as Timmy and Goose twirled a pair. From that day forth, Timmy was known not for sneaky-nabs, but for turning grumbly geese into town gabs. A hero now, he was hailed because of his tapsÑa grand hero clap! And every time you hear a tap-tap-tap or a honk from a goose in a grand parade lap, remember Timmy and his magical friendship nap! So always remember, sometimes a klep can become a pep, and a thief can find the hero in their own step!

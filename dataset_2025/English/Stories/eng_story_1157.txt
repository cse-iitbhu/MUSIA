I bought myself a telescope,
To look into the sky.
To see the solar system,
And the comets whizzing by.
I search the sky for planets,
for satellites and stars,
And now l’ve got a telescope,
They don’t seem very far.

It’s brought them very close to me,
It’s made the stars my friends...
Except, of course, when I make a mistake,
And look through the wrong end!

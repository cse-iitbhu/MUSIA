It was a holiday. The local market was
full of people. The toy shop opened
at 9 a.m. There were many toys
like wooden toys, soft
toys, board games,
bats and 
balls and many others. All the toys in the toy
shop were waiting to see who would buy them
“Look there,” shouted the toy kitten. They
saw two girls coming towards the shop.
But they passed by just looking at the
toys through the windows.
“Oh, no!” exclaimed all the toys at once.
After some time, a girl and a little boy stopped
at the door of the toy shop. Their father
stopped too.
The girl pointed at the board
games displayed in the
shop. Finally, she
chose the
game ‘Snakes
and Ladders’. 
“Ohhhh”, sighed the toys together.
Next, they saw a woman and her son coming
in. There was excitement in the shop
among the toys.
A talking doll said, “It
would be so nice if they
pick me up.”
“I would be happy if they chose me,”
thought the toy elephant.
“Namaste! How may I help you?”
asked the toy shopkeeper.
“Namaste! I want to buy a toy for
my son,” said the woman looking at
the toys in the racks.
“Aayi! I want that Vande Bharat train,”
said the little boy pointing to the toy train.
Aayi bought the Vande
Bharat toy train. The little
boy was happy.
Then two girls came in.
The toys looked at them eagerly.
“Zooooooooooooooom! Friends! I
think they would like to fly me,”
said the aeroplane confidently.
“Trin … Trin …! I think they may like to
play with me,” thought the toy phone.
One girl bought marbles and the other bought
the toy aeroplane.
After a while, a group of children came
into the toy shop.
“Wow! I like this toy elephant,”
said the girl with long hair.
“I will take this spinning top,”
said the boy with the red cap.
“I like these cute
dancing dolls,” said the boy in
the blue shirt.
 The children bought
the toys. They left the shop
cheerfully

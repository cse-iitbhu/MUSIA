The lion was the king of the jungle. One day, he spotted the king of the city. He sat atop an elephant, proud and erect. I will do the same, thought the lion. He summoned the elephant in the jungle. He told him what he wished to do.
The poor elephant was alarmed. He said, "Maharaj, why must you copy the king of the city?" The lion was adamant.
He sat astride the elephant but he did not look regal.
He looked silly! The monkey said, "Kings sit on howdahs.
They don't ride bare-backed elephants!"
The lion said, "Send for the howdah maker!" The howdah maker came.
He made a royal howdah.
It was placed on the elephant's back.
The lion jumped up and sat in it. As soon as the elephant took a few steps, the howdah began rocking. It had not been tied properly. It hit the branch of a tree and overturned! The lion fell down with a huge thud!
He never sat atop an elephant again.
He said, "I think, it is best to walk."

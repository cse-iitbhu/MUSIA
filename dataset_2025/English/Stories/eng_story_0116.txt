Shetty the magician was
returning home, when
all of a sudden it
began to rain. It
rained heavily. Shetty
looked around for
shelter and saw a pretty
little fir tree. He ran
towards it as fast as he
could.
Soon the rain
stopped. Shetty was
happy that he did
not get wet.
“Thank you,
you have been
kind to me. I would
like to reward you.
Ask for four wishes
and I will grant
them,” said the
magician
The sad fir tree had leaves like
needles and no birds ever made
their nests on it. So it said, “I
wish I had green leaves like
my other friends.”
Next morning, its wish was
granted. Soon a goat came
along and ate all the green
leaves. “Oh! dear,” said the fir
tree. “I wish I had gold leaves as
goats do not eat gold leaves.”
When the little fir tree woke up the next
morning, it was surprised to see gold leaves.
“How happy I am!” it said.
Two em n came along and stole the
gold leaves.
“I wish I had glass
leaves instead. Men do
not steal glass leaves.”
The next day its
glass leaves shone in
the bright sun. “How
happy I am!” it said.
At night the wind
blew whoo...oo...oo. All
the glass leaves broke.“Oh dear!” said the fir tree. I like
my old needle-like leaves best, for
goats do not eat them.
No man can steal them.
The wind will do them no
harm.”
The tree
went to sleep.
When it woke
up the next
morning, it
had all its
needles back
again.
“Oh! I never
was so happy,”
said the little
fir tree.

Said the Duck to the Kangaroo,
‘‘Good gracious! how you hop!
Over the fields and the water too.
As if you never would stop! 
 

‘‘My life is a bore in this nasty pond,
And I long to go out in the world beyond!
I wish I could hop like you!’’
Said the Duck to the Kangaroo.


Said the Kangaroo to the Duck,
‘‘This requires some little reflection:
Perhaps on the whole it might bring me luck.
And there seems but one objection.

‘‘Which is : if you’ll let me speak so bold,
Your feet are unpleasantly wet and cold.
And would probably give me the roo -
Matiz !’’ said the Kangaroo.

Said the Duck, ‘‘As I sat on the rocks
I have thought over that completely.
And I bought four pairs of worsted socks
Which fit my web-feet neatly.’’

Said the Kangaroo, ‘‘I’m ready!
All in the moonlight pale;
But to balance me well
dear Duck, sit steady!

And quite at the end of my tail!’’
So away they went with a hop and a bound.
And they hopped the whole
world three times round :

And who so happy, O Who,
As the Duck and the Kangaroo?

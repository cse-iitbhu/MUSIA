Soham and Sam are playing football.
Sam kicks the ball. It goes into
Mr Mane’s garden.

Sam asks for the ball.
‘‘Excuse me. May I have the
ball, please?’’
‘‘Sure, here it is.’’

After sometime again the ball goes into Mr Mane’s garden.
Now, Soham asks for the ball.

‘‘Give me the ball.’’

‘‘No, I won’t,’’ said Mr Mane.
Why does Mr Mane say ‘No’?
How is Soham feeling?
How is Mr Mane feeling?

Soham tries again.

‘‘Uncle, may I have the ball, please?’’
How does Mr Mane feel now?

‘‘Thank you,’’ said Soham.

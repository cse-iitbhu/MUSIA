Kut-kut Kutak Koo,
a hen was standing near
the coconut tree. A nut
fell down from the tree,
‘Dham!’ She said, “Kutkut-kut-kutak koo, the
sky is falling! The sky is
falling!”, and she ran.
The cock asked,
“Why are you running ?”
The hen said, “Run,
the sky is falling.”
The cock said,
 “I am also coming with
you”. So they ran
together.
On the way they met a
duck
The duck said,“Quackquack, why are you running ?”
The hen said,“Run, run,
Kut-kut kutak koo, the sky
is falling!”
The duck said,“I am also coming with you”
And they ran together.
A rabbit saw them running.
Rabbit,“Where are you going ?”
The hen said,“Run, run, the sky is falling.”
So they all ran together.
A fox was coming out of her cave.
She asked, “Oh! my dear, what is the matter ?”
The hen said,“The sky is falling, we are all going
to the king’s palace.”The fox said,“Friends, I know the king’s palace.
I will take you there.
The hen said,“Yes, yes.”
The fox went into the cave and the hen, the cock,
the duck, the rabbit, went into the cave one by
one.

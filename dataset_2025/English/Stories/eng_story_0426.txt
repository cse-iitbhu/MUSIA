In another village, there lived a farmer named Jack. He had a hen that laid a golden egg every day. Jack sold the eggs and soon became rich.

But Jack grew impatient. He didnâ€™t want to wait each day for one golden egg. He thought the hen must have many golden eggs inside her. If he could get all the eggs at once, he would be the richest man ever!

One day, in his greed, Jack decided to cut the hen open and get all the golden eggs. But to his shock, there were no golden eggs inside. By killing the hen, he lost his only source of golden eggs.

Jack regretted his action. He realized his greed had cost him a fortune.

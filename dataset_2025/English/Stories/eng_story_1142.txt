I love little Pussy,
Her coat is so warm.
And if I don’t hurt her,
She’ll do me no harm.
So I’ll not pull her tail,
Nor drive her away.
But Pussy and I,
Very gently will play.
I’ll sit by the fire,
And give her some food.
And Pussy will love me,
As I am gentle and good.
I love my little Pussy very much.

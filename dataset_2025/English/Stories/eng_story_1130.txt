Once there lived a girl, Reema.
She was very, very helpful.
When she went to school,
She helped everyone in the class.
When she came back home,
She helped her mother and father.
When she went to the playground,
She picked up small stones and thorns.
When she went for a picnic,
She took care of her friends.
When she went to a shop,
she selected things carefully.
She made greeting cards for her friends,
and gave them on their birthdays.
She was the best girl in our school.

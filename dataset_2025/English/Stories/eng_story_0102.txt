The second fish joined, "I am as talented in tricky water movements as you! I will be able to save myself and my family too. I support your stand, for I will not abandon the home of our ancestors for the sake of some mere talk of few passing fishermen."
 
But the frog was not convinced, he said, "My friends, my only talent is that I can foresee danger. You may stay, but I will leave with my family to some other pond before morning."
 
The very next morning, the fishermen came and cast their nets all over the pond. They had a big haul, and caught many fishes, frogs, tortoises and crabs.
Sahasrabuddhi and Satabuddhi tried hard to escape, but none of their tricks worked. They were caught, and when the fishermen dragged their net on the bank of the pond they were already dead.
 
Being the largest of the fishes the fishermen caught, they proudly displayed Sahasrabuddhi and Satabuddhi, and carried them separately as they started homewards.
 
Meanwhile, the frog, Ekabuddhi, had already found a well for shelter. Being worried and anxious, he came to the surface. But as he saw the fishermen departing with his friends, he became sad.
 
He told his wife, "They were very talented, but lacked the only talent that was most important. As for me, I may have only one talent, but I swim happily with my family!"

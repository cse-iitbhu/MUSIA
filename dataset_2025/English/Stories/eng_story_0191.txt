There were two frogs in
the pond. They wanted to
play. They saw two tree trunks
in the pond.
They brought a rope. They
tied it between the two
trunks. They made a swing.
“Oh ! What a nice swing.”, said
one.
“Oh Yes ! it is beautiful.”, said
the other.
After some time the swing
moved.
“What’s happening.”, said one.
“Oh! the trunks are moving.”, said
the other.
“Oh! We are flying.”. They
looked upwards.
“Oh no !” The frogs cried together, “It’s a crane, Help! Help!
Help!”

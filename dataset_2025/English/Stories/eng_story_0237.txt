I’ve decided I’m moving. I’m running away. I’m bored of this room and I’d rather not stay. The best place to live for a girl such as me, Is space, with no rules, and no gravity. My cat Bill and I will need astronaut suits. Our feet will be fine if we take some snow boots. We’ll wear yellow gloves, that you use to wash dishes. And bowls on our heads where we used to keep fishes. I know that it’s posed to be called a fishbowl. But no fish are left since Bill swallowed them whole. For our bodies I have found us some trash bags to wear. With our shiny new suits, we will be quite the pair! Now the spaceship dilemma is easy to fix, I built one last summer… you know, just for kicks. Space is enormous, you can fly all around. I bet I’ll see planets that nobody’s found!
As for space monsters, I am not that afraid. A monster’s a friend that you haven’t yet made. First thing I’ll do, is go looking for Saturn. And fly through its rings in my zag and zig pattern. Next I’ll go zipping by Venus and Mars. It’s easy since spaceships are faster than cars. Bill thinks that Neptune, has birds everywhere.
He’d be rather mad, if we didn’t stop there. Mercury seems like a great place to tan. But it might be too hot if I don’t pack a fan. When I’m hungry, I’ll munch on some Jupiter fruit. I hope that the juice doesn’t drip on my suit. On Uranus I’ll put on a wonderful play. The whole solar system can come — if they pay. It’s freezing on Pluto, especially at night. But it’s famous for hosting the best snowball fight. Eventually, I will fly back to the Earth. It’s really quite beautiful, for what it’s worth. In fact, there’s no rush to explore space just yet…
There are creatures down here that I still haven’t met. I can’t help but dream about all that’s in space.
But for now I’ll enjoy what is here in this place.

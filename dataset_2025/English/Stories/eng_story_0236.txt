Jerry woke up on Monday. He grabbed a box he was keeping under his bed. When he came downstairs his parents asked him what was inside. “Something really fun,” he said, but nothing more. Jerry walked to his bus stop with the box in his hands. Everybody at the bus stop asked him what was in it. “It’s very important,” he said, but nothing more. When he got to school the teacher asked him what was in his box. “It’s a secret,” he said, but nothing more.
At lunch his friends all crowded around and asked him to open it. “I can’t…It’s a gift,” he said, but nothing more. The box sat with him all day, and no one in class could think about anything else. His teacher didn’t let Jerry know, but she was curious too. She decided to send him to the principal for disturbing the class, hoping to get an answer. The principal asked Jerry what he was keeping in the box. "It’s not for you,” he said, but nothing more. Jerry went back to class and sat down. The entire class was watching as he handed the teacher a note from the principal. “Well if it’s a gift, Jerry, I suggest you deliver it now.” Jerry turned around and faced the class. He walked down the aisle and stopped at the desk of Oscar. Before today, nobody paid attention to Oscar. 
Nobody even talked to Oscar. And nobody had ever stopped at Oscar’s desk, until now. Oscar’s eyes lit up. Jerry handed him the box, with a new note.
Oscar read the note: Dear Oscar, This is my box. Enjoy.
P.S. It works better if you don’t open it. On Tuesday nobody had more people at their desk than Oscar.

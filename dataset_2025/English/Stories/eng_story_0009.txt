I’m running because
 I’m wanting to run.
 I’m not in a hurry,
 I’m running for fun.
 I’m crossing a field
 And I’ll run down the hill
 And I’ll run by the stream
That can never keep still.
I’ll run in the rain
And I’ll run in the sun.
I’ll run and I’ll run
And I’ll run and I’ll run!
I’m shouting because
I’m wanting to shout.
It’s a sort of noise
And there is no one aboutI’m crossing the field
And I’ll shout down the hill
And I’ll shout by the stream
That can never keep still.
I’ll shout in the rain
And I’ll shout in the sun.
I’ll run as I shout
And I’ll shout as I run.

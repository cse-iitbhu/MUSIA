Nina was a little girl.
She lived in a small village, near
Diveagar in Konkan.
Her parents worked in the field. Her
village was near the sea.
Her brother went to the grassland to
graze their cattle.
The older girls from her lane went to bring firewood from the forest.
Nina sat under a mango tree and
watched the birds, butterflies and
clouds. She too, wanted to fly like
them.
When she saw fishes in the sea, she
wanted to swim. When she saw the sea, she wanted to cross it and see
what is there on the other side.
After dinner when everyone slept in the front yard, she saw the
moon, the stars and wanted to touch them.
When her mother heard her wishes, she smiled and said, “Girls
cannot do all these things.”
Nina felt, “Will my wishes ever come
true?”
One day a smart lady came to their
village. She had a bag, some books and a
purse on her shoulder.
Nina ran to her and asked,
“Who are you? Are you going to live in
our village?”


The lady smiled and said, “Yes. I am Rutuja. I am going to live
in your village. We are going to start an ‘Activity Centre’ here for the
little girls like you. I also lived and went to school in a small village
like this.”
Nina was happy. She held Rutuja’s hand and took her home. She
offered her some tea and laddoos.
Rutuja said, “Thank you, Nina. I am a pilot. But I have left the job
because I want to teach different things to
the little girls from villages.”
“A pilot? Really?” Nina was
jumping with joy. “See, mother! Girls
can fly!” Rutuja smiled and said,
“They can sail across the ocean too.”
Mother too was very happy. Nina ran out
to tell everyone about the new ‘Activity
Centre’.

Looking down at you, Planet-Earth,
I remember you, as a Beautiful-Blue.
Now, your oceans are Black-With-Oil,
Look closely, you know it is true.
Your Rain-Forests are all gone now
And your ground is a sickly brown.
What-In-The-World, have They done to you
Pretty-Planet in the round.
Your White-Clouds once held Fresh-Water
Now they are filled with Acid-Rain.
Your plains are Barren-With-Erosion
They were once Overflowing-With-Grain.
When did your Clouds turn such Deathly-Gray,
Your air is Impossible to-Breathe.
Didnâ€™t your STEWARDS-EVEN-NOTICE,
Before they started to Gasp-And-Wheeze?
Could the Powers-That-Be, not save you
From such dismal end?
You were SO-RIGHT, in killing them off.
Now you can begin again.
Will your next Caretakers be smarter
And take better care of you?
I pray they learn to be Protectors.
We miss your Beautiful-Blue

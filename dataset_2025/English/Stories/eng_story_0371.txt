The Lion and the Cows 
Copyright Isamaj.com 
Once upon a time there lived four cows in the forest. Everyday they used to graze together in a particular spot. They were all friends. One day a lion saw the cows grazing together. 
The lion wanted to eat them so he went to catch them. When the cows saw the lion, all of them fought with him. The lion had to run away 
A few day passed and the cow quarreled between themselves and started grazing separately. One by one the lion killed all of them.

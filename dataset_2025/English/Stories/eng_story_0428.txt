A milkmaid named Patty had a pail of milk on her head. As she walked home, she started dreaming. “I’ll sell this milk and buy some eggs. The eggs will hatch into chickens. When they grow, I’ll sell them and buy a nice dress. Everyone will admire me at the market.”

Lost in her dreams, Patty forgot about the pail on her head. She started to twirl and dance, imagining her grand future. But alas! The pail fell, and all the milk spilled on the ground. Her dreams shattered with it.

Patty learned a hard lesson. She realized that by dreaming of the future, she had lost what she had in the present.

Chanda Mama! At times round as a circle
and at times different.
Once, he started counting
the stars. 1 … 2 … 3 … 10 …
21 … 45 … 99 … 100 …
311 … 516 … 890 …
yawn … 999 …
Chanda Mama fell asleep!
The Sun peeped out from behind the
clouds. It was morning. Chanda Mama
woke up in the evening. He began to
count again. But he had forgotten
where he had stopped!By the time he remembered, the night was over.
However, he continued to count the stars night
after night. Often, he would forget the count.
One night, he was very upset. He began
to cry. “Ooohh … Ooohh … What is this?
I am never able to complete my counting.”
On seeing his tears, the Sun smiled,
“Don’t worry! Why do you cry? I can tell
you how many stars there are in the sky.”
“Really? How many?” Chanda Mama was
surprised.
The Sun replied joyfully, “The number
of lovely children is the same as the
number of stars in the sky.”
Chanda Mama was happy! Now, the
Moon came out every night. He would look
at the stars. He would look at the children and
he would smile happily

One day, Nasruddin was chatting
with his friends.
He began to boast, “No one
can match my skill in
archery.
I string the bow, take aim,
and shoot the arrow...
Wh...o...o...sh.
The arrow is sure to hit
right on target.”
Hearing this, one of
his friends immediately
brought a bow and
some arrows.
Giving them to
Nasruddin, he said,
“Here, Nasruddin!
Take this bow and
arrows.”
Then pointing towards a
target, he said, “Aim at
that target and shoot an
arrow.”Nasruddin held the bow in his hands, strung it,
aimed at the target and shot an arrow.
Wh...o...o...o...o...
The arrow didn’t hit the target!
Instead it fell down somewhere in the
middle.
“Ha...ha...ha...ha...”
His friends started
laughing.
They said, “Hey,
Nasruddin! Is this
your best aim?”
“Oh, no!
Not at all,” said
Nasruddin,
defending himself.
“This wasn’t my aim.
It was Azad’s aim.
I just showed you how
Azad shoots an arrow.”
Saying this, Nasruddin picked
up another arrow.
Once again, he strung the bow, aimed at the target,
and shot the arrow.
This time, the arrow fell a little further from where it
had fallen before.
But it certainly
didn’t hit the target!
They asked Nasruddin,
“And this must be
how you shoot an arrow!”
“Of course not,”
argued Nasruddin.
“Even this aim was not mine.
It was the chief guard’s aim.”
Now somebody remarked,
“Well...
Now who’s next on
the list?”
Hearing
this, all the
friends burst
out laughing.
Nasruddin
didn’t say a word.
He quietly picked up
one more arrow.
And again...
And this time
Nasruddin was really
lucky! The arrow hit
right on the target!Everybody stared at Nasruddin,
their mouths agape in amazement.
Before anyone could say anything,
Nasruddin said triumphantly, “Did you
see that? It was my aim!”

Amber : Namaste! I am Amber. I would like to talk to you.
May I?
Neem Baba : Sure, dear Amber. I know you. You played in my
shade in your childhood. You may call me ‘Neem
Baba’.
Amber : I have seen you almost everywhere. Please tell me
something more about yourself.
Neem Baba : I am very old. I was born millions of years ago
somewhere in North India or Myanmar. Soon, my
family spread outside India.
Amber : Outside India? Where else can neem be found?
Neem Baba : My family can be found in many Asian and African
countries and even in some parts of America.
Amber : That’s wonderful! Who gave you your name? Neem Baba : The story of my name is very
thought-provoking. I was born
in India and given Sanskrit
names such as Arishta (the one
who cures diseases), Nimba and
Nimbaca. The name ‘Neem’ is
given by the Iranians.
Amber : Really?
Neem Baba : Yes, in Hindi, my name is Nimb. In
India, I have other names—Nim,
Leemba, Nimori, Nimbamond,
Nimbe and Nimo.
Amber : You are so well known! That is
wonderful.
Neem Baba : Dear Amber, we become well
known for what we do. People
find us useful and that is why
they know us. Scientists call us
‘bitter grace of God’, ‘nature’s gift
to man’, and ‘cleanliness-parting
tree’. Some even call us ‘magic
tree’ and ‘the tree of the twentieth
century’

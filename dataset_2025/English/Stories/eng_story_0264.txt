There were five friends who lived in a forest -Monkey, Mouse, Rabbit, Squirrel and Bear.
One day, they all went for a picnic. They played hide -and - seek.
They played cops -and - robbers.
They raced each other.
They played till they were tired. Monkey said, "Time to eat.
Everybody get something yummy."
They all ran to bring their share.
Rabbit brought carrots.
Mouse pulled up a juicy radish. Monkey got apples. Bear brought a cabbage.
Squirrel got tomatoes.
They washed everything.
They cut the fruits and vegetables and mixed them well. Now, it was time to eat. Bear said, "Wow! What is this? It looks so nice!"
Mouse said, "This is called chaat." Rabbit said, "I call it Panchranga, a mix of five colours." Squirrel fluffed up her tail and said, "Let us call it Wondermix!" Monkey said, "It is called salad.
Eat it and you will grow strong." Mouse said, "From now on, I am going to eat a lot of salad.
I have to grow up to
be a lion."
All five of them said, "Ha, ha, ha!"

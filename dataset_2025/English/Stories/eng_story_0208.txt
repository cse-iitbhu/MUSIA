All the animals of the forest teased Jessie the rabbit about her shy ways. But when a friend was in trouble, it was the shy Jessie who saved the day with her courage and quick thinking.
She watched the other animals run around and play, admiring them from afar. She had always been the shy one, and they always played without her.
"I may look silly and scared, but at least I’m always prepared for danger," thought Jessie. She would hide and curl up whenever she heard a crack or saw a shadow looming over her hole.
The whole forest was in a wild panic. The animals trampled over everything in their rush to escape, leaving behind a cloud of dust and the burning forest. Jessie, safe underground, was the only one left. 
Jessie had cleverly stashed away food and water in her hole. She had always known that danger might come one day, and she wanted to be ready. She was relieved to have enough supplies to last until the fire was over.
Then, in the distance, Jessie heard a desperate cry. "Help! Someone help me, please!" Jessie didn't want to leave her hole—she knew the fire was spreading fast.But then she heard the cry again... and again. She couldn’t just hide while someone was in trouble. 
Jessie was scared, but she couldn't leave Bailey behind. With a deep breath, she raced towards him, her little feet pounding against the scorched earth.
 "Jessie, please, you have to get this thing off!" Bailey cried. Jessie ran in frantic circles, searching for a way to help.
Without hesitation, Bailey gently held Jessie by her ears and carried her away from the fire to the cool, safe hills.

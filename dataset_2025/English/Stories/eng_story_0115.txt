Ring! Ring! Ring! Off goes the alarm clock at six in
the morning. Neha makes a face and covering her ears with a
pillow, snuggles under the warm blanket. But she knows she
has to get up. She mutters to herself
This alarm clock always rings at six and pulls me out
of the bed! It’s so unfair...Oh, how I would love to sleep a
little longer in the morning! I wish this clock would forget its
job sometimes.
Something falls. Neha smiles
Oh!
My clock has
fallen. How
happy I am!
Tomorrow I
can get up
late.
Next morning
there is no
alarm. So
Neha sleepsEven this wish of Neha’s comes true. The
next morning there is not only no alarm clock, there
are no birds either. But there is someone else who
does not want her to miss the school bus. Can you
guess who it is? The big bright Sun! He fills Neha’s
room with a warm smileOh, my eyes! Now it’s the Sun waking me
up! Why can’t he let me be?
and sleeps.
The small
chirpy birdswhich come to the window sill every morning find
Neha still sleeping.Wake up dear! Wake up fast!Neha gets up with a start.
Oh, no! If it’s not the alarm clock, it’s these
birds… why don’t they leave me alone?
Even this wish of Neha’s comes true.
Next morning the Sun is behind the
clouds. So, Neha snores till she hears
her mother’s voice...
Wake up, sleepy head.
You will miss the bus.Oh no! Why does
mother have to
wake me up?There is no
escape now.
Neha gets up and
gets ready. Can
you imagine
what happens
the next day?
Neha wakes up
with a start. Her
watch says it is
six o’clock. She
calls out to her
motherNeha : Ma, who woke
me up today?Narrator :
Who else? You, of course!
But, I was sleeping,
how could I …?
Now, tell
me, why do you
eat your lunch
every day at
one in the
afternoon?
I feel
hungry.
Whydo you sleep at
nine every night?
Because I feel sleepy.
There is a clock inside you which tells you
when to eat, when to sleep and when to wake up.
Oh! Ooh! I better rush now. I don’t want to
miss the bus.
RELAX! Today is Sunday!
Oh! Oh! Oh!

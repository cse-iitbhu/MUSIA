In a lush forest lived an old stag who was known for his
kindness. Each day, he warmly greeted
his fellow animals and birds. Though
the forest offered plenty of food,
the stag preferred staying on
a small hillock with tender grass.
The hillock was
covered in soft, green grass,
which the old stag enjoyed.
Every day, he would come
down to meet his friends,
and all the animals
and birds loved himOne day, the stag fell ill. He
struggled to reach the hillock.
The stag knew that fresh,
healthy food and proper rest
would help him to get well soon,
so he ate the tender grass and
decided to rest for a while.
The old stag could not go down
the hillock to greet his friends.
His friends were worried. When they learnt that the stag
was unwell, they came to check on him.
“Dear stag! How are you?” asked a deer.
“Too weak to come down and meet you all,”
replied the stag.
“Get well soon, dear stag!”
said the deer.The animals wished him a speedy recovery and left.
However, before they went back into the forest, the animals
ate the fresh green grass growing on the hillock.
One day, the stag fell ill. He
struggled to reach the hillock.
The stag knew that fresh,
healthy food and proper rest
would help him to get well soon,
so he ate the tender grass and
decided to rest for a while.
The old stag could not go down
the hillock to greet his friends.
His friends were worried. When they learnt that the stag
was unwell, they came to check on him.
“Dear stag! How are you?” asked a deer.
“Too weak to come down and meet you all,”
replied the stag.
“Get well soon, dear stag!”
said the deer.

“The grass is so tender
and nice,” said an
elephant.
“I have never eaten
such juicy green leaves,”
said a giraffe.
 Word soon spread about the tender green grass. Soon,
all the animals who came to visit the stag feasted on the
tender grass. Anyone who came to visit the stag would also
eat the grass.
Soon, there was not much
grass left for the old stag to
eat. He started becoming
weaker as days passed. His
friends felt ashamed. They
realised how their greed had
made them forget about
their friend, the
old stag.
They understood
that not much
grass was left forthe stag to eat
and recover. The
animals decided
to find food
elsewhere in the

46 Santoor Grade 4
forest and not disturb the hillock. Some of them
also brought fresh leaves for their friend.
It rained well that week. The grass soon grew
back, and the old stag had enough food once again.
Slowly, the old stag recovered from the illness.
The animals learnt the most important lesson:
“Nature has enough for everybody. But we need to
use its resources wisely.”

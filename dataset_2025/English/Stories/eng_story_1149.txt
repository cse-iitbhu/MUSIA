Sakshi found a big box. She opened it.
There was a fairy and some paints in the box.
“Hello Sakshi, shall we do some painting ?” asked the fairy.
She gave Sakshi a paint brush.
First, they painted with violet and indigo colours.
Then, they painted with blue and green colours.
And then, they painted with yellow, orange and red colours.
Sakshi said, “Look at our rainbows!”
“Will your parents like our
rainbows?” asked the fairy.
“Yes!” said Sakshi. My parents
will like our rainbow pictures
and will say, “You have made a
beautiful painting!”
The fairy smiled and hugged
Sakshi. Sakshi said good bye to
the fairy.

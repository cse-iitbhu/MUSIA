Once a lion was sleeping under a tree. A mouse saw him. He
ran up the lion’s tail and climbed on his back. He jumped all
over his body. He started sliding down the lion’s face again and
again.
 The lion got up. He got very angry. He caught the little
mouse in his paw. He said angrily,“ You naughty mouse, how
dare you disturb me? Now see, how I punish you. I will eat you

The mouse was afraid. He started trembling.
He pleaded, “O lion, the king of jungle, I am really sorry.
Please forgive me. Please let me go. I will help you some day.”
The lion laughed and said, “Oh really? you little mouse, how
can you help me? That’s so funny! Anyway go, get away from
here.” Then he set the mouse free.

“Thank you friend, thank you so much.” said the mouse and
ran away quickly.

A few days later, the lion was caught in a hunter’s net. He
was roaring loudly. The mouse heard it and ran to the lion. He
saw the lion caught in the net. He called his friends. All the
mice came together and nibbled the big net with their sharp teeth.
They set the lion free. The lion said, “Thank you dear little
mouse. You saved my life.

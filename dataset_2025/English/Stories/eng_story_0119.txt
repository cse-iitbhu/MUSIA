A learned Pundit once visited the court of
Akbar. He told the King and his courtiers
that he had mastery over many different
languages.
The Pundit could speak many
languages fluently. He was so fluent that
no one could find out what his mother
tongue was. He challenged everybody atthe court to name his mother tongue.
When everyone failed, the challenge was
taken up by Birbal.
That night, Birbal went quietly to the
Pundit’s room when he was asleep. He
whispered into the Pundit’s ear and
tickled it with a feather. The Pundit, half
awake, cried out suddenly and shouted
out words in his mother tongue.
Birbal came to the court the next day
and told everyone that the Pundit’s
mother tongue was Telugu. The Pundit
was surprised and accepted the truth.
King Akbar then asked Birbal, “How
did you find the truth?”
Birbal answered, “In times of difficulty,
a person speaks only in his mother
tongue.” He also told the King how he had
gone to the Pundit’s room at night to find
out the truth.

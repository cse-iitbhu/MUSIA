Long distance trade, rapid transport
of goods and centres of large scale
production are factors that brought
together people engaged in different
types of work. This gave rise to cities.
It became necessary to keep permanent
records of the expanding trade and
growing production. By now, signs and
symbols had already come into use for
the purpose of record-keeping Broken pieces of clay pots (potsherds)
with such signs have been found in
large numbers during excavations. The
increase in trade and production and the
growth in the volume of records to be
kept resulted in much modification and
improvement in the signs and symbols
used for these purposes. In this way, each
culture developed its own script.

It is true that rise in trade had been
the major factor that contributed to the
emergence and development of cities.
However, the culture of those cities
had its roots in the culture of village settlements of the New Stone Age. The
faith system rooted in the agricultural
way of life continued in the urban way
of life too. The social life and festivals based on agricultural faith systems
became more elaborate in cities that had
prospered because of the rise in trade.
Grand temples were built in many cities.
Chiefs of those temples became chief
administrators of those cities. Later, the
positions of the temple head and that of
the king went to the same individual. This
was the beginning of the ancient urban
civilizations of the world. We will learn
more about them in the next lesson.

Chinna was a little boy who lived in a village.
He studied in grade 4. He was a bright boy who
liked to read storybooks
and learn new things.
He had many
friends with whom
he played. But,
most of all, he
loved to play with
his little pet “kid”
named Tara.
Tara was a five-monthold kid, milky white in
colour. One day,
while coming back from
school, Chinna stopped at
Chacha’s shop. He saw a pair of
beautiful, shiny tinkling bells. He went inside the
shop and politely asked the shopkeeper to show
him the tinkling bells.“Ten rupees please,” Chacha said.
Chinna liked the bells
a lot. He put his hand in his
pocket to take out the money.
He was shocked to
find that his money
was missing. “Oh!
Where is the money
Dadaji gave me
yesterday?”
He searched all his
pockets but couldn’t
find the money.
Feeling sad,
he returned the tinkling
bells to Chacha and began
walking home.Chinna reached home.
He removed his shoes and
placed them in the corner.
He went inside and dropped
his school bag on the
study table. He sat on
the chair and rested his
head on the table.
His mother Kamala, who had
been watching all this, came to Chinna.
She asked gently, “What happened, Chinna?”
 Kamala laid her hands softly on his
shoulders. At once, Chinna hugged her
and started crying. On seeing
this, Kamla wiped his tears.
After a while, Chinna told her
about the missing money.
Kamla consoled him,
saying, “I’m so sorry,
dear. It’s ok, don’t cry. I’ll
give you money to buy the
bells. But, make sure to
be careful with money in
the future”.
Chinna smiled and
said, “Sure Amma”.
“That’s my boy! Cheer up! Now, let’s go to the market to
buy some fruits and vegetables,” Kamala said warmly.Kamala and Chinna went to the market. They
bought apples, mangoes, tomatoes and brinjals.
Chinna also wanted pineapples. So, they stopped
at the pineapple stall.
“What is the cost of the pineapples?”
Kamala asked. “Forty-five rupees each,” replied
the fruit seller.
Kamala bought two pineapples and gave him a
hundred-rupee note. She asked Chinna to take
the change. Then, she went to other shops to buy
some more fruits.
The fruit seller gave Chinna two ten-rupee notes.
Hiding a mischievous smile, Chinna ran to his
mother.
“Amma, do you know? The fruit seller gave me
ten rupees extra by mistake. Can I buy the bells
and some chocolates?” whispered Chinna.“Chinna, that’s very bad. It is stealing. How did you feel
when you found your money missing?” asked Kamla.
“I felt very sad and angry!” replied Chinna.
“The fruit seller will also feel the same
when he comes to know the mistake.
Now, be a good boy,” said
Kamala gently.
Chinna looked at his
mother thoughtfully. He ran
back to the fruit seller to return
the extra money. The fruit seller
was very happy. “You are an
honest boy,” he praised him.
Chinna ran back to his mother.
Kamla felt pleased with Chinna’s honesty and took
him to Chacha’s shop to buy the tinkling bells.
Chacha was about to close his shop. ‘Wait!’ called
Chinna. ‘Do you still have the bells?’ ‘Yes, I do’ said
Chacha. Chinna paid him ten rupees and they both
 happily walked home. The bells were
 tinkling in Chinna’s pocket. Hearing the
 sound of bells, Chinna’s pet kid Tara
 came running out. Chinna happily tied
 the tinkling bells around Tara’s neck

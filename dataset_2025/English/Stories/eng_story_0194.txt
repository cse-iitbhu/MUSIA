Manish was eight years old. He
went to school everyday. One day
on his way back home he stopped
near a tree to take some rest. There,
he saw a baby bird under a tree. It
was very small and unable to fly. It
was making a strange sound.
Perhaps it was crying.
Manish was very kind and
helpful. So, he thought to help the
baby bird. He looked up and saw a
nest on the tree. Two little birds were
playing in it. Manish picked up the
baby bird and climbed up on the
tree. He carefully put the baby bird
back in its nest. The three baby
birds were together again.
Just then the mother bird
returned. She sang a song to thank
Manish for his help.
Manish waved to the birds and
went back home happily.

Once there was a boy.
His name was Joy.
Joy had a dog. The dog’s name was Tommy.
Joy liked Tommy very much.
Joy said, “Come, Tommy, let’s go for a walk.”

“ It is very hot.”
“ We will go to the pond.”
Joy and Tommy began to walk.
The pond was inside a forest.
Suddenly, Tommy saw a fox passing by.
Tommy ran after the fox.
“Stop, Tommy ! Stop !” Shouted Joy.
But Tommy did not stop. 

Joy ran after Tommy, but he
could not catch Tommy.
“Oh, Tommy is lost!” cried Joy.
Joy sat on a stone and sobbed.
“Tommy’s gone and I’m lost !
What will I do?” he cried.
Then Joy saw Tommy coming back soon.
 Joy hugged Tommy and cried in joy.

‘‘I’m still lost, but I have you,” he said.
‘‘Don’t worry, Joy. I know the way,” said Tommy.
We’ll go. And Tommy and Joy reached home
safely.

The Starflower and the Hidden Kingdom
In a tiny town, beneath the moon's glow, lived a girl named Elara, her heart all aglow. One night, she found a flower so bright, sparkling and twinkling, a magical sight. "This is the Starflower!" the villagers would say, "Make a wish, Elara, before it flies away." With a wish in her heart for her village to grow, the ground opened up with a mighty show! Down she tumbled into a kingdom unseen, ruled by an enchanted and mysterious queen. "Elara, you’re the one with a heart pure and bright. Help break my curse with courage and might!" Elara's quest began with a quest grand, to find three treasures hidden across the land. First, the Feather of Gold from a bird of flame, hidden atop Mountain Volcane! Next, the Crystal Tear of the serpent of sea, buried in a cave, dark and mystery. Last, the Silver Heart deep in forest old, where the tall trees whisper secrets untold. With artifacts in hand, Elara knew true, the curse was broken, revealing skies blue! Returned to her village, now no longer unseen, remembered forever as the bravest they'd seen.

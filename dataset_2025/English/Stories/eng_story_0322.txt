Once on a bright summer’s sunny day, a Grasshopper was singing then he saw an Ant working hard to collect food, the grasshopper said, “Why do you work so hard in summers? Summers are for fun, relaxation and enjoyment. Come let us sing and enjoy”.

But Ant said, “I am collecting food for the winters and I recommend you to do the same.”

Grasshopper said, “We have got plenty of food at present. Why bother about winter now?”.

The Ant ignored him and went on its way.

When the winter came grasshopper had no food to eat.

He saw that Ant and begged for food, but she said, “When I worked hard, you enjoyed”.

Then grasshopper learned his lesson the hard way.

It is my first day at school.
Mummy is holding my hand and walking with me.
"I am grown up now," I say. "Let go, let go!"

Everyone is inside now. I am the only one outside. The teacher comes out. She smiles at me. I smile back.
Mummy says, "Rani, I will be here when you come out." I let go of her hand. She waves to me. I run inside. Mummy will be there after school!

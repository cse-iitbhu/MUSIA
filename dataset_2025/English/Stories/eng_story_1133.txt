Shyam started in his horse cart to go to the fair.
On the way, Madhu and Meera said,
“Can we come?”
“Oh, yes!” said Shyam.

The dog saw them.
He asked, “Can I come?”
“Oh, yes!” said Shyam.
They were going through the fields.
The peacock saw them and asked,
“Can I come to the fair?”
“Oh, yes!” said Shyam.
When they were crossing the river,
The frog asked, “Can I come to the fair?”
 “Oh, yes!” said all of them.
Shyam said, “Come and sit near me.”
They saw the fair from a distance.
The peacock was so happy, it
spread it’s feathers and started
dancing. But one feather touched
the dog’s ear. He sprang up and
barked loudly. 

Madhu was frightened. Meera
fell on the frog. The frog fell on
the horse.
The horse was so frightened that
he ran helter-skelter.
Shyam fell off. Then Madhu and
Meera also fell off. One by one all
of them fell off.
The horse kept running and stopped
when it reached near the fair.
Shyam, Madhu, Meera, the dog, the peacock and the frog were all
panting when they reached.
Till then the horse became quiet and relaxed. In the evening they
returned happily in the horse cart.

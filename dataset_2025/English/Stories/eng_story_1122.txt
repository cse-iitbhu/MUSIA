I found a tiny little seed
And planted it outside.
Almost at once it started
To grow up, tall and wide.
It sprouted leaves from everywhere,
And soon became quite big.
Iâ€™m not sure what it is yet -
Apples, peas or figs?
No matter how it turns out,
I know that it will be
My own completely special
Something-or-other-tree!

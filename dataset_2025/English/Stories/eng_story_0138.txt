Once upon a time,
in a small village at
the foot of the mighty
Himalayas, lived a
young girl named
Minam. She loved to
listen to stories
about the
mountains
from her
grandfather,
who was once
a Sherpa. The
two of them
would often
go on long
walks together.One sunny morning, Minam's grandfather said,
"Minam, you have become strong, and you can
walk for a long distance. Today, I will take you on
a special journey to the mountains. We'll see the
beauty of the Himalayas up close!"
Minam was excited and quickly packed her bag
with some rotis with achaar, two water bottles,
and her favourite fruit, apples.
They started their journey early in the
morning. As they walked, Minam saw beautiful
flowers, tall trees, and heard the sounds of birds
she had never heard before.
The air was fresh and cool,
and Minam felt
very happy.
After a while, they reached a small river with
clear water. Minam's grandfather said, "This is
where we will have our lunch."
They sat by the river, enjoying their rotis and
watching the fish swim. Minam dipped her feet in
the cool water and laughed with joy while eating
an apple.After their meal, they
continued their journey.
They climbed higher and higher,
and soon they could see yaks.
Minam's grandfather told her, "Yaks
are very important to the people living in the
mountains. They give us milk, wool, and help
carry heavy loads."As they walked further, they reached a place
where the ground was covered with snow. Minam
had never seen so much snow before! She and her
grandfather made a small snowman. They laughed
and played, making memories Minam would value
forever.
Finally, they reached the top of a hill. From
there, Minam could see the huge peaks of the
Himalayas shining in the sun. It was a beautiful
sight. Her grandfather pointed to the
highest mountain and said,
"That is Mount Everest,
the tallest
mountain in the
world. Many
brave people
have tried to
climb it."Minam felt happy to be living near such
wonderful mountains. As the sun began to set,

 A Journey to the Magical Mountains 115
Minam and her grandfather
started their journey back home.
On their way down, they
heard the beautiful musical
notes of a Santoor. It was
played by an old man sitting
under a tree. They
also saw a family of
mountain goats
jumping from rock to
rock. Minam’s
grandfather
explained, “These
goats are good at
climbing. They
can go to placeswhere it’s very hard for people to reach.”
By the time they reached their village, it was
getting dark. Minam was tired but very happy.
She turned to her grandfather and said, “Thank
you for taking me to the magical mountains. I will
never forget this day.”
Her grandfather smiled and replied, “The
mountains are truly magical, Minam. They teach
us about strength, beauty, and the wonders of
nature. Always remember to respect and protect
them.”
Minam promised to take care of the mountains
and share their magic with everyone she met.

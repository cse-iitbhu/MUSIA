Sunday is a holiday, Sohan and Sweety
are going to visit Grandma and Grandpa. 
“ Hello! Grandma.’’
“ Hello! Grandpa.’’ 
Grandma has been busy today. She has
cleaned all the rooms, she has wiped all
the windows.
“ Are you tired, Grandma? Let’s give
Grandma a rest today. Just sit and have a
rest.’’ 
“ Come on Sohan!
Come on Sweety!’’
Grandpa, Sohan and Sweety work in the
kitchen. They are busy.
“Come to the kitchen, Grandma. Come and see.’’ 
“Oh! Soup, sandwiches and salad,
what a treat!’’ 

“Grandma, do you like Banana
Delight?’’
“Oh! I love it!

“And now there’s a surprise for you!
Grandma, open this parcel.’’
“Oh! A mobile phone! What a surprise! 


But …!’’
“Grandma, no buts, now. I know your
problem. You don’t know how to use this. But
don’t worry, we will all help you.’’

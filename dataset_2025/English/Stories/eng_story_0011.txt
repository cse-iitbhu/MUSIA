Raja Krishna Chandra ruled over a part of Bengal about two
hundred years ago. His court jester was Gopal Bhand. Though Gopal Bhand had
not studied books, he was a very wise man.
Once, a very learned man, Mahagyani Pandit came to the court. He spoke
all the Indian languages fluently and perfectly. He had good knowledge of
philosophy and religion.
He answered all the
questions very wisely.
People were amazed to
talk to him but no one
could identify his mother
tongue.
Whenever they asked
him, he smiled arrogantly.
He said, “A truly wise
man will easily know my
mother tongue.”
Raja Krishna Chandra
was very upset. So he announced a reward for anyone who could tell the Pandit’s
mother tongue.
All the scholars listened to Mahagyani attentively. But no one could identify
his mother tongue.“Shame on you”, said the king angrily. All the scholars were
silent. Gopal Bhand stood up hesitantly. He said, “Your Highness, give me a
chance.” “How could you tell?”, asked the king. “Your Highness! I won’t talk.
He will tell you himself”, answered Gopal Bhand.
The next morning the king was walking in his garden. Gopal Bhand ran upto him quickly and said, “I have
told Mahagyani Pandit that you
are going to honour him with a
garland of roses.” “What!”, said
the king surprisingly.
The next moment the king
saw Mahagyani Pandit walking
in expectantly. He was in silk
clothes.
Gopal Bhand hid himself
behind the hedge. As soon as the
Pandit came near the hedge, he put
his leg out and tripped the Pandit.
The Mahagyani pandit fell down on
the freshly watered ground. He sat
up and shouted at Gopal Bhand in
his mother tongue.
Gopal Bhand said, “Your
Highness, now you know, what the
Pandit’s mother tongue is!”
Mahagyani Pandit got up and said to Gopal Bhand, “You wise man, you
have trapped me intelligently,” and he went away

Look! A kite fight!
Oops! The purple kite is torn. Oh no! The yellow one's gone. Aha! The red kite floats down. Climb up high. Stretch out and grab! Quick! Zoom away. Now step inside and hide. Sprint right through without a stop. Slide over and dodge about. Ride on, don't let them load the hay. Hop off! Zig-zag through the market. Charge along, try not to crash. Push through faster! Make a dash! Yay! Hurray! Its all mine! this red kite now belongs to me.
Oh no! Another chase?

The Farmer and the Crane 

There once was a farmer who was very worried about his crop getting eaten by the birds. So he laid a trap for the birds. 
Next day he managed to catch a flock of the birds. A crane also got trapped in the net. The crane pleaded with the farmer for his freedom. 
The farmer retorted: "You have been found in the company of these birds who were eating my seeds So I will not spare you

Moral of the Story; Bad company is harm

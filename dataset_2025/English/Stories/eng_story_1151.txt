Five little seeds,
Five little seeds,
Three will make flowers,
And two will make weeds.

Under the leaves,
Under the snow,
Five little seeds are
Waiting to grow.

Out comes the sun,
Down comes a shower.
And up come the three
Pretty pink flowers.

Out comes the sun,
That every plant needs.
And up come two
Funny old weeds.

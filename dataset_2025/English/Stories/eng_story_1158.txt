Yesterday we all had been to a park for the school picnic.
The park was very beautiful. There were green trees.
There was a bird sitting on a tree. Pink and white flowers bloomed in the green grass.
There were butterflies flying around the flowers.
Nina, Yash and I played with a pink ball.
Mahesh and Deepa enjoyed swinging on the swing.
Salma enjoyed playing on the long purple slide.
Jenny and Aayush sat on the blue seesaw.
I saw a man walking with his dog.
We had a lot of fun in the park.

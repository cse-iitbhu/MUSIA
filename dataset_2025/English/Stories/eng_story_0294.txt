It's not easy being a tiger.
Yes, tigers are beautiful and fierce. But tigers are also big and heavy.
This makes it difficult for them to hunt for food.  Out of every twenty times a tiger hunts, it eats only once. When a tiger moves through the forest, The langur calls, just like an old man coughing!
KHAU! KHAU! KHAK!
KHAU! KHAU! KHAK! AWOOOO! HAWOO00!
The barking deer calls, like a scared dog!
AWOOOO! HAWOOOO! OOW! OOW! OOW!
The spotted deer calls, like a little bird!
OOW! OOW! OOW! The whole forest knows the tiger is here! The tiger wonders, where has everyone gone?
AHUUUN? AHUUUN?

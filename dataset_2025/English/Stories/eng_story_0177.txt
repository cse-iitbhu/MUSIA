Mrs Fitzgerald:[collecting up the cards] And that’s all I can tell you, Mrs
Pearson. Could be a good fortune. Could be a bad one.
All depends on yourself now. Make up your mind — and
there it is.
Mrs Pearson: Yes, thank you, Mrs Fitzgerald. I’m much obliged, I’m
sure. It’s wonderful having a real fortune-teller living
next door. Did you learn that out East, too?Mrs Fitzgerald: I did. Twelve years I had of it, with my old man rising
to be Lieutenant Quartermaster. He learnt a lot, and I
learnt a lot more. But will you make up your mind now,
Mrs Pearson dear? Put your foot down, once an’ for all,
an’ be the mistress of your own house an’ the boss of
your own family.
Mrs Pearson: [smiling apologetically] That’s easier said than done.
Besides I’m so fond of them even if they are so thoughtless
and selfish. They don’t mean to be...
Mrs Fitzgerald: [cutting in] Maybe not. But it’ud be better for them if they
learnt to treat you properly...
Mrs Pearson: Yes, I suppose it would, in a way.
Mrs Fitzgerald: No doubt about it at all. Who’s the better for being spoilt—
grown man, lad or girl? Nobody. You think it does ’em
good when you run after them all the time, take their
orders as if you were the servant in the house, stay at
home every night while they go out enjoying themselves?
Never in all your life. It’s the ruin of them as well as you.
Husbands, sons, daughters should be taking notice of
wives an’ mothers, not giving ’em orders an’ treating ’em
like dirt. An’ don’t tell me you don’t know what I mean,
for I know more than you’ve told me.
Mrs Pearson: [dubiously] I—keep dropping a hint...
Mrs Fitzgerald:Hint? It’s more than hints your family needs, Mrs
Pearson.
Mrs Pearson: [dubiously] I suppose it is. But I do hate any
unpleasantness. And it’s so hard to know where to start.
I keep making up my mind to have it out with them but
somehow I don’t know how to begin. [She glances at her
watch or at a clock ] Oh — good gracious! Look at the
time. Nothing ready and they’ll be home any minute and
probably all in a hurry to go out again.
[As she is about to rise, Mrs Fitzgerald reaches out across
the table and pulls her down.]
Mrs Fitzgerald: Let ’em wait or look after themselves for once. This is
where your foot goes down. Start now. [She lights a
cigarette from the one she has just finished.]
Mrs Pearson: [embarrassed] Mrs Fitzgerald—I know you mean well—in
fact, I agree with you — but I just can’t — and it’s no use you trying to make me. If I promise you I’d really have it out
with them, I know I wouldn’t be able to keep my promise.
Mrs Fitzgerald: Then let me do it.
Mrs Pearson: [ flustered] Oh no—thank you very much, Mrs Fitzgerald—
but that wouldn’t do at all. It couldn’t possibly be
somebody else—they’d resent it at once and wouldn’t
listen—and really I couldn’t blame them. I know I ought
to do it—but you see how it is? [She looks apologetically
across the table, smiling rather miserably.]
Mrs Fitzgerald: [coolly] You haven’t got the idea.
Mrs Pearson: [bewildered] Oh—I’m sorry—I thought you asked me to
let you do it.
Mrs Fitzgerald: I did. But not as me—as you.
Mrs Pearson: But—I don’t understand. You couldn’t be me.
Mrs Fitzgerald: [coolly] We change places. Or—really—bodies. You look
like me. I look like you.
Mrs Pearson: But that’s impossible.
Mrs Fitzgerald: How do you know? Ever tried it?
Mrs Pearson: No, of course not...
Mrs Fitzgerald: [coolly] I have. Not for some time but it still ought to work.
Won’t last long, but long enough for what we want to do.
Learnt it out East, of course, where they’re up to all these
tricks. [She holds her hand out across the table, keeping
the cigarette in her mouth] Gimme your hands, dear.
Mrs Pearson: [dubiously] Well—I don’t know—is it right?
Mrs Fitzgerald: It’s your only chance. Give me your hands an’ keep
quiet a minute. Just don’t think about anything. [Taking
her hands] Now look at me. [They stare at each other.
Muttering] Arshtatta dum—arshtatta lam—arshtatta
lamdumbona...
[This little scene should be acted very carefully. We are to assume that the
personalities change bodies. After the spell has been spoken, both women,
still grasping hands, go lax, as if the life were out of them. Then both come to
life, but with the personality of the other. Each must try to adopt the voice and
mannerisms of the other. So now Mrs Pearson is bold and dominating and Mrs
Fitzgerald is nervous and fluttering.]
Mrs Pearson: [now with Mrs Fitzgerald’s personality] See what I mean,
dear? [She notices the cigarette] Here — you don’t want that. [She snatches it and puts it in her own mouth, puffing
contentedly.]
[Mrs Fitzgerald, now with Mrs Pearson’s personality, looks down at herself and
sees that her body has changed and gives a scream of fright.]
Mrs Fitzgerald: [with Mrs Pearson’s personality] Oh — it’s happened.
Mrs Pearson: [complacently] Of course it’s happened. Very neat. Didn’t
know I had it in me.
Mrs Fitzgerald: [alarmed] But whatever shall I do, Mrs Fitzgerald? George
and the children can’t see me like this.
Mrs Pearson: [grimly] They aren’t going to—that’s the point. They’ll have
me to deal with—only they won’t know it.
Mrs Fitzgerald: [still alarmed] But what if we can’t change back? It’ud be
terrible.
Mrs Pearson: Here—steady, Mrs Pearson—if you had to live my life
it wouldn’t be so bad. You’d have more fun as me than
you’ve had as you.
Mrs Fitzgerald: Yes—but I don’t want to be anybody else...
Mrs Pearson: Now—stop worrying. It’s easier changing back—I can do
it any time we want...
Mrs Fitzgerald: Well—do it now...
Mrs Pearson: Not likely. I’ve got to deal with your family first. That’s
the idea, isn’t it? Didn’t know how to begin with ‘em, you
said. Well. I’ll show you.
Mrs Fitzgerald: But what am I going to do?
Mrs Pearson: Go into my house for a bit—there’s nobody there—then
pop back and see how we’re doing. You ought to enjoy it.
Better get off now before one of ’em comes.
Mrs Fitzgerald: [nervously rising] Yes—I suppose that’s best. You’re sure
it’ll be all right?
Mrs Pearson: [chuckling] It’ll be wonderful. Now off you go, dear.
[Mrs Fitzgerald crosses and hurries out through the door right. Left to herself,
Mrs Pearson smokes away —lighting another cigarette—and begins laying out
the cards for patience on the table.
After a few moments Doris Pearson comes bursting in left. She is a pretty girl
in her early twenties, who would be pleasant enough if she had not been spoilt.]
Doris: [before she has taken anything in] Mum —you’ll have
to iron my yellow silk. I must wear it tonight. [She now sees what is happening, and is astounded.] What are you
doing? [She moves down left centre.]
[Mrs Pearson now uses her ordinary voice, but her manner is not fluttering and
apologetic but cool and incisive.]
Mrs Pearson: [not even looking up] What d’you think I’m doing—
whitewashing the ceiling?
Doris: [still astounded] But you’re smoking!
Mrs Pearson: That’s right, dear. No law against it, is there?
Doris: But I thought you didn’t smoke.
Mrs Pearson: Then you thought wrong.
Doris: Are we having tea in the kitchen?
Mrs Pearson: Have it where you like, dear.
Doris: [angrily] Do you mean it isn’t ready?
Mrs Pearson: Yours isn’t. I’ve had all I want. Might go out later and get
a square meal at the Clarendon.
Doris: [hardly believing her ears] Who might?
Mrs Pearson: I might. Who d’you think?
Doris: [staring at her] Mum—what’s the matter with you?
Mrs Pearson: Don’t be silly.
Doris: [indignantly] It’s not me that’s being silly—and I must say
it’s a bit much when I’ve been working hard all day and
you can’t even bother to get my tea ready. Did you hear
what I said about my yellow silk?
Mrs Pearson: No. Don’t you like it now? I never did.
Doris: [indignantly] Of course I like it. And I’m going to wear it
tonight. So I want it ironed.
Mrs Pearson: Want it ironed? What d’you think it’s going to do—iron
itself?
Doris: No, you’re going to iron it for me... You always do.
Mrs Pearson: Well, this time I don’t. And don’t talk rubbish to me about
working hard. I’ve a good idea how much you do, Doris
Pearson. I put in twice the hours you do, and get no wages
nor thanks for it. Why are you going to wear your yellow
silk? Where are you going?
Doris: [sulkily] Out with Charlie Spence.
Mrs Pearson: Why?Doris: [wildly] Why? Why? What’s the matter with you? Why
shouldn’t I go out with Charlie Spence if he asks me and
I want to? Any objections? Go on—you might as well tell
me...
Mrs Pearson: [severely] Can’t you find anybody better? I wouldn’t be
seen dead with Charlie Spence. Buck teeth and halfwitted...
Doris: He isn’t...
Mrs Pearson: When I was your age I’d have found somebody better than
Charlie Spence—or given myself up as a bad job.
Doris: [nearly in tears] Oh — shut up!
[Doris runs out left. Mrs Pearson chuckles and begins putting the cards together.
After a moment Cyril Pearson enters left. He is the masculine counterpart
of Doris.]
Cyril: [briskly] Hello — Mum. Tea ready?
Mrs Pearson: No.
Cyril: [moving to the table; annoyed] Why not?
Mrs Pearson: [coolly] I couldn’t bother.
Cyril: Feeling off-colour or something?
Mrs Pearson: Never felt better in my life.
Cyril: [aggressively] What’s the idea then?
Mrs Pearson: Just a change.
Cyril: [briskly] Well, snap out of it, Ma—and get cracking.
Haven’t too much time.
[Cyril is about to go when Mrs Pearson’s voice checks him.]
Mrs Pearson: I’ve plenty of time.
Cyril: Yes, but I haven’t. Got a busy night tonight. [moving left
to the door] Did you put my things out?
Mrs Pearson: [coolly] Can’t remember. But I doubt it.
Cyril: [moving to the table; protesting] Now—look. When I asked
you this morning, you promised. You said you’d have to
look through ‘em first in case there was any mending.
Mrs Pearson: Yes — well now I’ve decided I don’t like mending.
Cyril: That’s a nice way to talk — what would happen if we all
talked like that?Mrs Pearson: You all do talk like that. If there’s something at home
you don’t want to do, you don’t do it. If it’s something
at your work, you get the Union to bar it. Now all that’s
happened is that I’ve joined the movement.
Cyril: [staggered] I don’t get this, Mum. What’s going on?
Mrs Pearson: [laconic and sinister] Changes.
[Doris enters left. She is in the process of dressing and is now wearing a wrap.
She looks pale and red-eyed.]
Mrs Pearson: You look terrible. I wouldn’t wear that face even for Charlie
Spence.
Doris: [moving above the table; angrily] Oh — shut up about
Charlie Spence. And anyhow I’m not ready yet — just
dressing. And if I do look terrible, it’s your fault — you
made me cry.
Cyril: [curious] Why—what did she do?
Doris: Never you mind.
Mrs Pearson: [rising and preparing to move to the kitchen] Have we any
stout left? I can’t remember.
Cyril: Bottle or two, I think. But you don’t want stout now.
Mrs Pearson: [moving left slowly] I do.
Cyril: What for?
Mrs Pearson: [turning at the door] To drink—you clot!
[Mrs Pearson exits right. Instantly Cyril and Doris are in a huddle, close together
at left centre, rapidly whispering.]
Doris: Has she been like that with you, too?
Cyril: Yes — no tea ready—couldn’t care less...
Doris: Well, I’m glad it’s both of us. I thought I’d done something
wrong.
Cyril: So did I. But it’s her of course...
Doris: She was smoking and playing cards when I came in. I
couldn’t believe my eyes.
Cyril: I asked her if she was feeling off-colour and she said she
wasn’t.
Doris: Well, she’s suddenly all different. An’ that’s what made me
cry. It wasn’t what she said but the way she said it—an’
the way she looked. Cyril: Haven’t noticed that. She looks just the same to me.
Doris: She doesn’t to me. Do you think she could have hit
her head or something—y’know—an’ got—what is it?—
y’know...
Cyril: [staggered] Do you mean she’s barmy?
Doris: No, you fathead. Y’know—concussion. She might have.
Cyril: Sounds far-fetched.
Doris: Well, she’s far-fetched, if you ask me. [She suddenly
begins to giggle.]
Cyril: Now then—what is it?
Doris: If she’s going to be like this when Dad comes home... [She
giggles again.]
Cyril: [beginning to guffaw] I’m staying in for that—two front
dress circles for the first house...
[Mrs Pearson enters right, carrying a bottle of stout and a half-filled glass.
Cyril and Doris try to stop their guffawing and giggling, but they are not quick
enough. Mrs Pearson regards them with contempt.]
Mrs Pearson [coldly] You two are always talking about being grownup — why don’t you both try for once to be your age? [She
moves to the settee and sits.]
Cyril: Can’t we laugh now?
Mrs Pearson Yes, if it’s funny. Go on, tell me. Make me laugh. I could
do with it.
Doris: Y’know you never understand our jokes, Mum...
Mrs Pearson: I was yawning at your jokes before you were born, Doris.
Doris: [almost tearful again] What’s making you talk like this?
What have we done?
Mrs Pearson: [promptly] Nothing but come in, ask for something, go out
again, then come back when there’s nowhere else to go.
Cyril: [aggressively] Look—if you won’t get tea ready, then I’ll
find something to eat myself...
Mrs Pearson: Why not? Help yourself. [She takes a sip of stout.]
Cyril: [turning on his way to the kitchen] Mind you, I think it’s
a bit thick. I’ve been working all day.
Doris: Same here.
Mrs Pearson: (calmly) Eight hour dayCyril: Yes—eight hour day — an’ don’t forget it.
Mrs Pearson: I’ve done my eight hours.
Cyril: That’s different.
Doris: Of course it is.
Mrs Pearson: [calmly] It was. Now it isn’t. Forty-hour week for all now.
Just watch it at the weekend when I have my two days
off.
[Doris and Cyril exchange alarmed glances. Then they stare at Mrs Pearson
who returns their look calmly.]
Cyril: Must grab something to eat. Looks as if I’ll need to keep
my strength up. [Cyril exits to the kitchen.]
Doris: [moving to the settee; anxiously] Mummy, you don’t mean
you’re not going to do anything on Saturday and Sunday?Mrs Pearson: [airily] No, I wouldn’t go that far. I might make a bed or
two and do a bit of cooking as a favour. Which means, of
course, I’ll have to be asked very nicely and thanked for
everything and generally made a fuss of. But any of you
forty-hour-a-weekers who expect to be waited on hand
and foot on Saturday and Sunday, with no thanks for it,
are in for a nasty disappointment. Might go off for the
week-end perhaps.
Doris: [aghast] Go off for the week-end?
Mrs Pearson: Why not? I could do with a change. Stuck here day after
day, week after week. If I don’t need a change, who does?
Doris: But where would you go, who would you go with?
Mrs Pearson: That’s my business. You don’t ask me where you should
go and who you should go with, do you?
Doris: That’s different.
Mrs Pearson: The only difference is that I’m a lot older and better able
to look after myself, so it’s you who should do the asking.
Doris: Did you fall or hit yourself with something?
Mrs Pearson: [coldly] No. But I’ll hit you with something, girl, if you
don’t stop asking silly questions.
[Doris stares at her open-mouthed, ready to cry.]
Doris: Oh — this is awful... [She begins to cry, not passionately.]
Mrs Pearson: [coldly] Stop blubbering. You’re not a baby. If you’re old
enough to go out with Charlie Spence, you’re old enough
to behave properly. Now stop it.
[George Pearson enters left. He is about fifty, fundamentally decent but solemn,
self-important, pompous. Preferably he should be a heavy, slow-moving type.
He notices Doris’s tears.]
George: Hello — what’s this? Can’t be anything to cry about.
Doris: [through sobs] You’ll see.
[Doris runs out left with a sob or two on the way. George stares after her a
moment, then looks at Mrs Pearson.]
George: Did she say ‘You’ll see’...?
Mrs Pearson: Yes.
George: What did she mean?
Mrs Pearson: Better ask her.[George looks slowly again at the door then at Mrs Pearson. Then he notices
the stout that Mrs Pearson raises for another sip. His eyes almost bulge.]
George: Stout?
Mrs Pearson: Yes.
George: [amazed] What are you drinking stout for?
Mrs Pearson: Because I fancied some.
George: At this time of day?
Mrs Pearson: Yes — what’s wrong with it at this time of day?
George: [bewildered] Nothing, I suppose, Annie—but I’ve never
seen you do it before...
Mrs Pearson: Well, you’re seeing me now.
George: [with heavy distaste] Yes, an’ I don’t like it. It doesn’t look
right. I’m surprised at you.
Mrs Pearson: Well, that ought to be a nice change for you.
George: What do you mean?
Mrs Pearson: It must be some time since you were surprised at me,
George.
George: I don’t like surprises—I’m all for a steady going on—you
ought to know that by this time. By the way, I forgot to
tell you this morning I wouldn’t want any tea. Special
snooker match night at the club tonight—an’ a bit of
supper going. So no tea.
Mrs Pearson: That’s all right. There isn’t any.
George: [astonished] You mean you didn’t get any ready?
Mrs Pearson: Yes. And a good thing, too, as it’s turned out.
George: [aggrieved] That’s all very well, but suppose I’d wanted
some?
Mrs Pearson: My goodness! Listen to the man! Annoyed because I don’t
get a tea for him that he doesn’t even want. Ever tried
that at the club?
George: Tried what at the club?
Mrs Pearson: Going up to the bar and telling ’em you don’t want a glass
of beer but you’re annoyed because they haven’t already
poured it out. Try that on them and see what you get.
George: I don’t know what you’re talking about.

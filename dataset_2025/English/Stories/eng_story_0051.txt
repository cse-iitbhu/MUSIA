A girl sits at her bedroom window, looking down at the street. She is waiting for summer.

She wants to eat ice cream and go swimming. She wants picnics and strawberries.

She is tired of winter jackets and gloves. She is tired of grey skies and snow.

Her mother says that summer is far away. Her father says that more snow is coming.

Still, she sits at the window, waiting for some sign that summer has arrived.

Just then, she sees an ice cream truck driving down the street.

“An ice cream truck! That MUST mean it’s summer now!” she squeals.

She runs to her closet and puts on her bathing suit and her summer hat. 

She runs down the stairs and out the door and…

CRUNCH! 

She looks down and sees her bare feet….in the icy grass.

“But…but… I saw an ice cream truck!” she says, confused.

She looks up just in time to see the ice cream truck turn the corner and pull into the auto repair shop.

“I want to be big,” says
Little Monkey. “I want
to be strong.”
A wise woman hears
him. “Take this magic wand,”
she says, “and all your
wishes can come true.”
A giraffe comes by. He stretches his long
neck. He eats the sweet leaves at the top of
the trees.
“I want a long neck,” says Little Monkey.
“POP!”
His neck grows long, just like the giraffe’s.
Little Monkey is happy.
An elephant comes down to the river.
He fills his trunk with water.
He blows it all over himself.
“I want to do that too!”,
says Little Monkey. “BANG!Just like that, he grows
a trunk.
He is very happy. “This
is fun!” he says.
Next, Little Monkey sees
a zebra. “I want stripes like
those,” he says. “WHIZZ!”
Little Monkey has
stripes all over his body,
just like the zebra.
He is very, very happy.
He goes to the river to
try out his new trunk. He
looks down.
He sees himself in the
water. “Mother!” he cries.
“Help! A monster!”“That’s not a monster,” says his mother. “That’s you.”
“You want a giraffe’s neck, an elephant’s trunk and
stripes like a zebra. Don’t you remember?”
Little Monkey cries and cries. “I look AWFUL!” he says.
“I want to be myself again.”
There is a POP, a BANG and a WHIZZ.
Little Monkey is himself again. He jumps for joy.
He throws the magic wand into the river.
He never wants to be anyone else again

Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, a 34 year old armyman
finished second in the men's double trap shooting event on
Tuesday, the 17 August 2004 in the 28th Olympic games in
Athens. This was India's first individual silver medal in Olympic
history in shooting event . Lets read what he said after he won
the medal.Feelings while receiving
the medals
It felt absolutely great.
It certainly feels good to win
a medal for the country.
And that makes it even
more good because the
country feels prouFeelings while draped in
country
s flag at the
presentation
It was a sense of relief
that I was able to accomplish
something for the country.
And the flags, I wanted
something close to the symbol
which represents the country.
So the flag was the best thing,
and I just wanted to wrap it
around myselfPreparations in the last
few days
There was a mix of
everything. There has to be
a healthy balance.
Whenever I felt that I was
getting anxious, I would
relax, crack a joke or talk
to somebody and make the
environment lighter for
myself. But whenever I
needed focus, I would
close my eyes and think of
the target of how I would
do, how my emotions
would be, what is my game
plan for the match and
everythingFocus at the final
point
I realised that I was
missing because I was
losing aggression. When
you lose your
aggression, you lose
your natural way of
shooting. I then told
myself, I should go hard
at the target. That's how
I made those last two. I
was absolutely focussed
on the target, I could see
nothing else but the
target.

I like doing my chores.
Well, maybe not all of them but most of them. 
Hmm, maybe not most of them. But a lot of them.
Okay, maybe not a lot of them. But a few of them. 
Well, maybe not a few of them but … None of them!
Just fooling … I really do like doing my chores.
When I do my chores, it helps my Mommy and Daddy, and as you know Mummies and Daddies sometimes need a lot of help.
Sometimes I have chores that I do not like to do. When that happens I make up a silly game and that makes the chore easier.
Like yesterday, I had to put my laundry away and I pretended that I was hiding it from my Mommy. It was fun and I think I remember where I put it. 
Just fooling … It is in my dresser where it belongs.
Sometimes when all my chores are done, we go to the park or have other special time. 
I know if my chores weren’t done we wouldn’t be able to do that.
“So be important and have some fun. Do your chores until they are done.”

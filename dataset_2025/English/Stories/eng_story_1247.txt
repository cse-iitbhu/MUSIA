Once there lived a
couple who spent a
lot of time in idle
talk. One day, the
husband said, “I have always wanted to keep cows. If,
by chance, I get some extra
money from somewhere, I am
going to buy a few cows.”

“But that means a lot of work.
You have to feed the cows, walk them,
bathe them, milk them - cows need a
lot of looking after. One cow would be
enough. There’s no need to buy more
cows,” said the wife.
“But think of all the milk we’ll
get if we buy more,” said the husband.
“That’s true.” The wife agreed.
“There will be so much milk that we
can even have plenty of dahi and butter
and ghee. Wouldn’t it be lovely ! How
lucky that I have all these earthen pots
kept aside. I’ll use one of the pots for
milk, one for dahi, one for butter. The
ghee, I’ll put in another jar. And I’ll
use this remaining pot to send milk to
my sister.”
“Send milk to your sister! Who
said you could send milk to your
sister!”
“There will be plenty of milk,
if we have so many cows. Why
shouldn’t I send it to my sister ?”
“Because we are going to sell it
in the market - that’s why. I will
decide what to do with all that milk.
And not a drop of it goes to your
sister, remember!”
“I’ll see how you can stop me
from sending a pot full of milk to
my dear sister. I do all the hard
work running after the cows so
naturally I will decide what happens
to the milk. Just try stopping me !”
the wife exclaimed.

“Is that so !” shouted the husband.
“Watch this, then!” He began to lift
and smash the earthen pots one by
one. His wife began to scream.
Gopal Bhand, who was passing
by, heard all the commotion and rushed inside. When he heard what
had happened, he picked up a stout
stick that stood in a corner and began
to swish it through the air and pound
it on the floor. The husband and wife
were both astounded to see his antics.
“What are you doing?” they
enquired.
“Move aside,” said Gopal Bhand.
“I have to drive away your greedy
cows. You have let them wander and
now they have ruined my field of
beans and cucumbers! Oh, my lovely
field of beans and cucumbers!”
“But you don’t have a field of
beans and cucumbers!” said the
husband. As soon as he said that,
Gopal Bhand stopped wielding the
stick and looked at him with raised
eyebrows. The husband and wife
understood what he was trying to tell
them. Can you tell what he wanted
to say?

There was a boy called Badal.
He lived with his mother in
a village and they were very
happy. One evening, when
Badal was returning from
school, he saw a puppy
shivering in the cold. 
Badal brought him home.
“Can this puppy stay with us,
Maa?” asked Badal. “Yes beta,
but only if you promise to take
care of the puppy”, said his
mother with a smile. Badal
and his mother named the
puppy Moti. As days went by,
Moti grew up and loved Badal.
They became best friends.
They ate and played together.
Moti followed Badal wherever
he went. They played their
favourite games together.
One rainy day, while Badal was
on his way home from school, he
slipped on the muddy lane and
fell into a deep pit. He tried hard,
but could not come out of the
pit. Badal’s mother was worried
when he did not come home in
time. Moti too was waiting at the
gate. Badal’s mother gathered
the neighbours to help search for
him. Moti too accompanied them.
Moti caught Badal’s
scent. He followed the scent
and went near the pit and
started barking. This alerted
the neighbours who were
searching for Badal. They
used a rope to pull Badal
out of the pit. Everyone was
relieved. Badal hugged and
thanked Moti.

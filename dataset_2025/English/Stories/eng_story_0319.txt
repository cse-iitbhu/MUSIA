A milkmaid was on her way to the market to sell some milk from her cow. As she carried the large
jug of milk on top of her head, she began to dream of all the things she could do after selling the
milk.
“With that money, I’ll buy a hundred chicks to rear in my backyard. When they are fully grown.
I can sell them at a good price at the market.”
As she walked on, she continued dreaming, “Then I’ll buy
two young goats and rear them on the grass close by. When
they are fully grown, I can sell them at an even better price!”
Still dreaming, she said to herself, “Soon, I’ll be able to buy
another cow, and I will have more milk to sell. Then I shall
have even more money...”
With these happy thoughts, she began to skip and jump.
Suddenly she tripped and fell. The jug broke and all the
milk spilt onto the ground.
No more dreaming now, she sat down and cried.

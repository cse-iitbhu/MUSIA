Kamal had a dog. He was called Bhaunkoo. One day, Kamal was feeding Bhaunkoo and he gave him a roti. Down came a monkey and snatched the roti away!
He climbed up the wall on the terrace before settling down to eat. A crow saw the roti from the corner of his eye. He swooped down and made off with the roti before the monkey could take a bite. He flew to the pipal tree in the courtyard. There was a peacock perched on the pipal tree. He caught sight of the roti. The crow flew off to save it. Bhaunkoo barked loudly, "Bhaun, Bhaun, Bhaun, Bhaun!" The crow panicked. He cawed, "Kaanv, Kaanv!" As he opened his beak, the roti fell down. It fell in the courtyard. Bhaunkoo snapped it up immediately. The roti was back where it belonged!

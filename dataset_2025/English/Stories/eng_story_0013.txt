After lunch, Piglet went to see Rabbit.
"Come in !", Rabbit called.
Piglet tried to go in, but he couldn't open
the door.
2. The Missing Whistle
Piglet pushed and pushed.
At last the door opened
and he fell inside.
"What a mess !",
he said, looking around.
Rabbit was searching through a
drawer.
"I' ve lost my whistle, " he told
Piglet. "I had it this
morning but I can't find it now !""I'll help you look for it," said Piglet.
So, Piglet looked under the table and
under the stool while Rabbit searched
through the cupboards.
"Brother ! I can't find it anywhere !",
grumbled Rabbit.
When he turned around he couldn't find
Piglet, either !
Do you know where Piglet is ?
" Where are you ?", he asked.
"I'm here !", said Piglet,
scrambling out of the pile of things
Rabbit had thrown over him.
"I didn't find the whistle, "he said."Well, we'd better tidy up now and
have some tea," said Rabbit.
He picked everything up and put them
in the cupboardâ€“even Piglet !
Did they find the whistle ?
Rabbit fetched a bowl of "Poha" he'd
made .
"That smells nice !", said Piglet,
climbing out of the cupboardRabbit was eating the "Poha" when he bit on
something hard.
"My whistle !" he cried.
"It was hiding in the 'Poha' all the time !"
laughed Piglet.

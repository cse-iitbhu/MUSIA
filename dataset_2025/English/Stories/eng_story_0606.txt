Augie never liked eating vegetables. But one day, at dinner time, he heard the strangest thing in the world. 
"No more beans for me," said his father. "Beans make you fast." 
Beans make you fast? 
Now that was odd.

The next morning, he found his big brother Hudson in the garden, and asked what that could possibly mean. 
Hudson smiled behind his hand. "Are you sure he said fast?" he asked. 
"Definitely," said Augie. "Beans make you fast. What's that about?"

Hudson thought about it. He turned his face to the sun and smiled wide. 
Then he thought some more, and finally turned back to Augie. 
He said, very seriously, "Did you eat all your dinner last night?"

Augie thought that was another strange question. 
"I never eat my dinner," he said. "It's always yucky stuff. Beans and peas, carrots and pasta. None of it's as good as biscuits and chocolate and ice-cream."

"Ahh," said Hudson. "That explains it." 
"That explains what?" 
"That explains why you don't know what Dad meant. You see, it's an amazing thing about the food you eat at dinner. It all has MAGICAL PROPERTIES!"

Augie LOVED magic! 
"What kind of MAGICAL PROPERTIES?"

"Well, if you eat BEANS, it makes you FAST. It means that you can't help yourself, you have to jump up and run, and you'll find that you can run twice as fast as normal times. Try it tonight! 
BEANS MAKE YOU FAST!"

Augie couldn't WAIT for dinner that night!

That night's dinner was beans, pasta and fish. Augie took a big spoonful of beans. 
And AH AH AH! Suddenly he --was WHIZZING around the room! 
He was the fastest boy you've ever seen. 
He ran back and forth between the table and the window ten times in a minute!

"WOW!" said Augie. "That's AMAZING! 
BEANS DID MAKE ME FAST!"

"Why don't you try some pasta?" Hudson said. And winked. 
"What does pasta do?" 
"Well, PASTA makes you... FASTER!"

SO Augie took an enormous bite of pasta. 
And GEE WHIZ GOLLYKINS! He was positively ZOOMING around the room! 
Ten times as fast as before!

Augie sat down again, breathing hard. He couldn't stop smiling. 
"What else?" he whispered. "What do all the other foods do?"

"Well, FISH makes you Wish. Say a wish, and it might come true!" 
Augie took the biggest bite of FISH, and made a Wish. 
And he couldn't tell if he was imagining it, but he felt the strangest tingling on his face, which just might have been his secret wish to watch TV that night...

"And MEAT makes you SWEET. RICE makes you NICE. PIE makes you FLY..."

It was incredible. 
"Wow!" said Augie. "I love the sound of this!" 
"There's crazier ones..." whispered Hudson. "PEPPERS make you WRITE LETTERS. CARROT makes you TALK LIKE A PARROT. BROCCOLI makes you want to PLAY MONOPOLY..."

Suddenly Augie REALLY WANTED some broccoli. 
He loved Monopoly!

"And everyone knows 
HONEY MAKES YOU FUNNY..."

Augie suddenly realised that he couldn't wait for dinner tomorrow. 
But first, it was time for a nice cup of tea before bed.

"But TEA makes you....."

ugh-oh...

Somewhere in a lake, there lived a turtle, by the name of Kambugriv. Two swans, whose names were Sankata and Vikata, were her friends.

Every day, the three of them would go to the bank of the lake and tell each other stories about holy saints and hermits, and then go back home after sunset.

“After a few years, that part of the land had no rain and bit by bit, the lake began to dry up.

“The two swans were worried about it and said to the turtle, “This lake is becoming mud. We are worried as to how we will be able to survive here, without water.”

But we will find some way out, because even in bad times, a man should not lose hope, for by making an effort, he can certainly find a solution.’ “First look for a lake full of water. Then find a strong stick or a rope from somewhere.

Like the foolish turtle who fell off the stick.” And the people who depend on the luck are destroyed as Yadbhavishy was destroyed, by the fishermen.”

‘How was that?’ asked the male tittibha. And his wife again told him this story. THREE FISHES

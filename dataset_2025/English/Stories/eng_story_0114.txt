There was a girl named Rani who lived in a
village. She was very curious and used to
ask many questions to her family, teachers
and friends.
“Why is the sky blue?”
“Where does the Sun go at night?”
One evening, Rani heard her
mother singing, “Chanda mama door ke ...”
Hearing this, Rani asked her mother, “Amma, how
far is the Moon?” Amma said, “Rani, the Moon is very
far in the sky”.
Rani kept
on thinking
about the
moon and
fell asleep.
The next morning
Rani woke up hearing the
loud voice of her elder brother,
Pratik. He was pointing to the TV and shouting in excitement, “Look
Rani, India is on the
Moon!”
Rani looked at
the TV. She could
see photos of
some machines
on the Moon.
She heard a few
people talking
about the landing
on the Moon. She
was confused and asked Pratik, “How did
Chandrayaan reach the Moon?”Pratik replied that
his friend Vivaan’s
mother, Aunt Nandini, is
a scientist. “Shall we go
and talk to her?” asked
Pratik. Rani happily
agreed. Both Rani and
Pratik decided to visit
Vivaan’s house.Vivaanandhis
mother welcomed
them. Rani could
see many models
and photographs
of rockets in their
house.Nandini Aunty offered sharbat to the
children and said, “Rani, what do you want
to know?”
Rani replied, “People say India is on the
Moon. Can you please tell us
more about this?”
Aunty said, “Yes, of
course. Do you know
which vehicle is used
to go to the Moon?”
Pratik immediately
said, “I know Aunty, it
is a rocket. I had seen i t
on the TV”.
Rani pointed to the
models and photos of
rockets in the room
Nandini said, “Very good. Yes, a
rocket is used to reach the Moon.”
Rani asked, “WhatdoesChandrayaan
mean?”
Nandini replied, “Chandra means Moon
and Yaan means vehicle. On 14 July, 2023,
India became the first country to land on
the far side of the Moon.”
Rani jumped with excitement and
said, “Can I go to the Moon, too?”
Nandini smiled,
“Maybe, one day.”

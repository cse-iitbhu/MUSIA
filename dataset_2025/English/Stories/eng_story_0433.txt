Once upon a time, in a big green garden, there lived a busy and lively colony of ants.

These ants worked together to gather food, build their nest, and take care of each other.

But among them was an ant named Mani who didn’t like working with others.

He always told himself:

“I’m stronger and faster. Why should I wait for the others? I can do everything better on my own!”

One morning, when the other ants were getting ready to go collect food, Mani said proudly:

“I’ll go find a piece of food myself. I don’t need the group!”

The other ants looked at each other, and one of them said:

“Alright, Mani. Just be careful. You’re small and alone, and the world is a big place.”

Mani happily jumped off and started walking. Soon, he found a big piece of candy. His eyes lit up.

“Wow! Such a big candy! All mine!”

he said with excitement and started pulling the candy.

But it was too heavy. Mani pushed, pulled, and tried everything. He was sweating and getting tired.

Then he thought to himself:

“I wish the other ants were here to help me…”

At that moment, he heard familiar voices. The other ants had found him and smiled as they came closer.

“See? We told you teamwork is better. Now let’s carry it together.”

Mani felt a little embarrassed, but he smiled and said:

“You were right. We’re much stronger when we work together!”

From that day on, Mani always worked with the group. He had learned that when everyone works together, even the hardest jobs become easier.

On a beach by a tree, sat my family and me.
Then shouted a hog, "There's a Dog On A Log!!"
A Dog On A Log? Well, how can that be?
He must be saving that big, frightening flea.
Now why would a dog be saving a flea?
Especially in the water on the branch of a tree. 
I couldn't believe what I saw happen next.
Even that Dog On A Log was perplexed. 
The flea pulled on a rope and up came a boat.
I'll bet you can't guess what happened next.
A flea family ran from the dog's little toe.
They got into the boat and began to row.
Once on the shore, they ran through the sand.
Over a cookie in my left hand.
Right to the hog, that's where they went. 
They found a new home with an unpleasant scent.
As for the Dog, he's still riding that log.
As for me-Ouch-I think I have a flea.

Once upon a time there
was a small hill. A path went
up the hill.
It went through thick and lovely
woods of pine and fir trees.
People often walked on it to a
holy place.
One day when the sun
shone high in the sky, many
people were seen climbing up
the hill. They were climbing
slowly and carefully.
A girl also climbed the hill with them. Her name was
Meena.Meena was twelve years old. She carried a small boy
on her back.He was four years old. His hair was curly. His
eyes were black and his face was as fresh as the morning dew.
As the sunshine danced through the trees, Meena
climbed the hill slowly and steadily. Meena was happy. The
boy was also happy.
A man in the group looked
at Meena. He felt sorry for her.
He asked her, “My child, why are
you carrying the boy on your
back? Don’t you feel his load?”
Meena looked at him in
wonder. She could not
understand him. (Her brother
was unable to walk). Meena asked
, “Load? Of course not! He is my
brother!”

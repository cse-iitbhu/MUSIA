This Land Is Your Land (1940, revised in 1944) was originally titled God Blessed America For Me, is considered one of America's most famous folk songs. Guthrie composed it as a critical response to Irving Berlin's traditional patriotic song, God Bless America (1918, 1938), which Guthrie thought was unrealistic and complacent. Guthrie's patriotic tune is an endearing tribute to American populism. We offer the more familiar 1944 lyrics below, featured in our collection of Patriotic Songs.
This land is your land, this land is my land
From California to the New York Island
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me.

As I was walking that ribbon of highway
I saw above me that endless skyway
I saw below me that golden valley
This land was made for you and me.

I roamed and I rambled and I followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
While all around me a voice was sounding
This land was made for you and me.

When the sun came shining, and I was strolling
And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling
A voice was chanting, As the fog was lifting,
This land was made for you and me.

This land is your land, this land is my land
From California to the New York Island
From the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me.

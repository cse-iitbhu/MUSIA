Yash was happy.
His mother bought him new shoes.
He woke up early in the morning.
He went out to look at his new shoes.
‘‘Oh, no!’’ He cried.
‘‘There is only one shoe here!
Where is my other shoe?’’
He looked everywhere.
He couldn’t find it.
He sat outside on a step and sobbed.
Just then Moti came and started
wagging his tail. He barked.
‘‘Bow wow!’’
Yash looked at Moti.
‘‘Moti, have you seen my shoe?’’
‘‘Bow wow!’’ Moti barked
and ran to a tree in the front
yard. Yash followed Moti.
There was a hole under
the tree.
Yash saw his shoe in the
hole.
A big, fat rat had carried
it there.
Yash picked it up.

‘‘Thank God!’’ he said.
‘‘The rat has not nibbled my shoe! It
is in good condition.’’
‘‘Bow wow!’’ Moti agreed.
‘‘Thank you, Moti,’’ said Yash

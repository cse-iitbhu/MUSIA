I wake up in the morning.
I rub my eyes.
I cannot see my mother.
"Ma! Ma! Hurry up!! Ma is busy.
She says, "Good morning.
Get up! Go wash your face." I wash my hands and face.
I have a bath in a hurry.
I want to go soon.
"Ma, hurry up." "Yes! I am coming," Ma says to me. "I have to boil the milk, then I will come." I comb my hair and button my shirt. Now I am ready. "Ma, hurry up." Ma gives Didi her clothes. She helps Didi get ready. There is so much work in the morning. But I am in a hurry. "Ma, I am getting late." I pick up my water bottle and school bag.
I wear my chappals.
"Come on let us go.
Ma, hurry up." "Yes! I am coming. Let me comb your sister's hair. I need five minutes more and then we can go." I want to go now. I do not want to wait. I feel like crying. Didi has gone to school and I am still here. "I am almost done. I only have to fill water."
She always has something to do. "Ma, please, please, hurry up." "I am going. You better come with me."
I hold her hand and start pulling her. "Arre baba, let me switch off the lights." Finally we are out of the house.
Mother locks the door.
She says, "Why are you so impatient, my Raja?"
I like it when she calls me 'my Raja'.
Now my mother is walking with me.
I like that!!

Meow!! I mean: Hello, I am Clarice the Cat. I know I don’t look like a regular cat. It’s not because I’m skinny, and not because I’m fat. It is because my owner makes me a pretty cat. From dressing me in costumes
and flowery hats to painting my nails. Can you imagine that! She always treats me tenderly,
and feeds me twice a day. Miss Molly is never too busy to sit by me and play. She makes my pretty costumes from old dolls’ clothes and such. I never know what I’ll be wearing, but I know it will cause a fuss. Miss Molly is my favorite person, and as she grows and grows, I hope she will always be my friend,
and make me all my clothes. Purr! I mean. “Good Night!”

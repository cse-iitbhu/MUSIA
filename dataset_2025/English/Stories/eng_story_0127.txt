Many years ago, at the foothills of the Kaatskill (Kat-skill)
mountains, was a little village. In the village lived a
simple, good-natured fellow named Rip Van Winkle. He
was a kind neighbour, ready to help anyone. Everyone in
the village liked him. The children of the village shouted
with joy whenever they saw him because he played with
them, he taught them to fly kites and shoot marbles, and
told them long stories.
The only problem with Rip was that he was very lazy.
He did no work on his own farm and just idled away his
time. His fences were falling to pieces. His cow was going
astray. Weeds grew on his farm. Rip's constant
companion was his dog, named Wolf. To avoid work, he
would walk away into the forest with his dog.
One day, Rip just walked on and on and reached the
highest part of the mountains. It was late in the
afternoon when he reached there. Tired after his long
climb, he lay down and began daydreaming. It was soon
evening and he realised it would be night by the time he
reached his village.
Suddenly, he heard a voice calling out, “Rip Van
Winkle, Rip Van Winkle!” He looked around and saw a
short, old man, with thick hair and a grizzled beard
walking towards him with a barrel. He made signs to help
him carry the barrel. Rip hurried to help the stranger who
caught his hand tightly. Together
they reached a place where there
were some more odd looking
men, playing ninepins. They
were all dressed the same
way and all of them had
beards of various shapes
and colours. Even though
they were playing a game,
their faces were serious and there was silence! The only sound was the noise of the
balls, which echoed in the mountains like thunder.
As Rip and his companion reached them, they
stopped playing and stared at Rip with a fixed gaze. Rip
was really frightened. His companion emptied the
contents of the barrel into glasses and made Rip drink it.
Rip obeyed as he was trembling with fear. Since he was
thirsty he drank a few more glasses and slowly fell into a
deep sleep.
On waking up, he found that he was at the place
where he had first met the old man. He rubbed his eyes —
it was a bright sunny morning. “Surely, I have not slept
here all night,” thought Rip.
He looked around for Wolf, but he was nowhere. Rip
whistled for him. “Wolf! Wolf!” he then shouted. No dog
was to be seen. “Where has this dog gone?” he muttered
to himself. He began to descend the mountain to go back
to his village. As he neared the village, he met a number of people
but he didn't know any of them. The villagers also stared
at him equally surprised. “Who is this man?” said one.
“I've never seen him before,” said another, “look at his
long white beard and his wrinkled face.”
On hearing this, Rip stroked his chin and, to his
astonishment, he found his beard had grown a foot long,
and it was all white!
An old woman walked up to him and looked at his face
for a moment. Then she exclaimed — “It is Rip Van
Winkle! Welcome home again, old neighbour! Where have
you been these twenty long years?

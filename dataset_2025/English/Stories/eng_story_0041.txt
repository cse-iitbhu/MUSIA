The headmaster entered the class with a slightly flushed face and a hard ominous look
in his eyes. Swaminathan wished that he had been anywhere but there at that moment.
The headmaster surveyed the class for a few minutes and asked, “Are you not ashamed
of coming and sitting there after what you did yesterday?” Just a special honour to
them, he read out the names of dozen students or so, that had attended the class. After
that he read out the names of those that had kept away, and asked them to stand on their
benches. He felt that punishment was not enough and asked them to stand on their
desks. Swaminathan was among them and felt humiliated at that eminence. Then they
were lectured. When it was over, they were asked to offer explanations one by one.
One said that he had an attack of a headache and therefore could not come to school.
He was asked to bring a medical certificate.
The second said that while he had been
coming to school on the previous day,
someone had told him that there would
be no school, and he had gone back
home. The head master replied that if he
was going to listen to every loafer who
said there would be no school, he deserved
to be flogged. Anyway, why did he not
come to school and verify? No answer.
The punishment was pronounced; ten
days’ attendance cancelled, two rupees
fine, and the whole day to be spent on the
desk. The third said that he had an attack
of a headache. The fourth said that he had
stomachache. The fifth said that his
grandmother died suddenly just as he was
starting for school. The headmaster asked
him if he could bring a letter from his
father. No. He had no father. Then, who
was his guardian? His grandmother. But
the grandmother was dead, was she not?

No. It was another grandmother. The headmaster asked how many grandmothers a
person could have. No answer. Could he bring a letter from his neighbours? No, he
could not. None of his neighbours could read or write, because he lived in a very
illiterate part of Ellaman Street. Then the headmaster offered to send a teacher to this
illiterate locality to ascertain from the boy’s neighbours if the death of the grandmother
was a fact. A pause, some perspiration, and then the answer that the neighbours could
not possibly know anything about it, since the grandmother died in the village. The
headmaster hit him on the knuckles with his cane, called him a street dog, and pronounced
the punishment fifteen days’ suspension.
When Swaminathan’s turn came, he looked around helplessly. Rajam sat on the third
bench in front, and resolutely looked away. He was gazing at the blackboard intently.
But yet the back of his head and the pink ears were visible to Swaminathan. It was an
intolerable sight. Swaminathan was in acute suspense lest that head should turn and fix
its eyes on his; he felt that he would drop from the desk to the floor, if that happened.
The pink ears three benches off made him incapable of speech. If only somebody
would put a blackboard between his eyes and those pink ears!
He was deaf to the question that the headmaster was putting to him. A rap on his body
from the headmaster’s cane brought him to himself.
“Why did you keep away yesterday?” asked the headmaster, looking up. Swaminathan’s
first impulse was to protest that he had never been absent. But the attendance register
was there. “No..no..” I was stoned. I tried to come, but they took away my cap and
burnt it. Many strong men held me down when I tried to come… When a great man is
sent to gaol… I am surprised to see you a slave of the Englishmen… Didn’t they cut
off—Dacca Muslin—slaves of slaves! These were some of the disjointed explanations
which streamed into his head and which even at that moment he was discreet enough
not to express. He had wanted to mention a headache, but he found to his distress that
others beside him had one. The headmaster shouted, ‘‘Won’t you open your mouth?”
He brought the cane sharply down on Swaminathan’s right shoulder. Swaminathan kept
staring at the headmaster with tearful eyes, massaging with his left hand the spot where
the cane laid. “I will kill you if you keep on staring without answering my question”,
cried the headmaster.
“I..I.. couldn’t come,” stammered Swaminathan.
“Is that so? asked the headmaster, and turning to a boy said. “Bring the peon”.
Swaminathan thought, “What! Is he going to ask the peon to thrash me? If he does any
such thing, I will bite everybody dead.” The peon came. The headmaster said to him,
“Now say what you know about this rascal on the desk.”

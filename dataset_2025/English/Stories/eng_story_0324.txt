A Whirlwind Wander in Wondrous Oz
In a land full of Kangas and boomerangs swift, two girls took a trip for an adventurous lift. Meet Mia and Zoey, with backpacks so bright, ready to explore with hearts full of light. Jumping-off spot was Sydney, with its beautiful bay, 'G'day, Opera House!' the girls chirped to say. The seagulls flapped and flittered, a lively ballet, with sails of the harbor like wings at display. Through jungles so lush, they danced with delight, the leaves whispered stories, like green paper kites. The kookaburras laughed from high branches they leap, as birds of a feather, they'd seen and they'd keep. Next spot on the map was Uluru's grand sight, 'A giant red rock!' Mia squealed with delight. As the sun dipped down low, it glowed like a flame, shadows joined in a rhythmous game. 'Hear the hiss?' asked Zoey, as snakes slithered by, shimmering scales like jewels to the eye. With a hop and a skip they followed the lead, safe distance respected, a harmonious creed. Rainforests green, where waterfalls roar, the girls bathed in mist, their laughter outpour. Frogs leapt and splashed in games of delight, rainbows appeared in the droplets of light. A dingo in the distance, how curious it seemed, its ears perked with interest, eyes fiercely beamed. Yet gentle and calm, with no cause for dread, off the creature ambled, with a curious head. Across shimmering sands of beaches so wide, they built castles with seashells the waves couldn't hide. Crabs danced in circles, a beach parade near, music of the ocean was all they could hear. Through starry nights as they camped by the moon, they hummed to the tune of the Southern Cross's swoon. Koalas in tree-tops hummed peaceful refrains, the girls happy and sleepy in their sweet dreams' trains. Home was now calling, their journey a start, but adventures in Oz would stay sweet in their heart. With whispers of wind and footsteps so meek, 'We'll come back soon!' the girls promised with a cheek. A zoo-full of memories tucked safe in their brains, with songs of the outback like sweet, playful gains. Onwards they traveled, to family and town, their wondrous tales kept, in gold and in brown. Two wanderers once more, bold, fearless, and free, soon off on new journeys to lands yet to see. Adventure awaits for all those who dream, like Mia and Zoey, who made a great team!

Late again, Beinkensopp?
What’s the excuse this time?
Not my fault, sir.
Whose fault is it then?
Grandma’s sir
Grandma’s? What did she do?
She died sir.
Died?
She’s seriously dead alright sir.
That makes four grandmothers this term, Beinkensopp
All on PE days.
I know, it’s very upsetting sir
How many grandmas have you got Beinkensopp?
None sir.
You said you had four.
All dead sir
And what about yesterday, Beinkensopp?
What about yesterday, sir?
You were absent yesterday.
That was the dentist, sir
The dentist died?
No sir, my teeth sir.
You missed the maths test, Beinkensopp!
I’d been looking forward to it, sir.
Right, line up for PE
Can’t sir.
Excuses, Excuses and Excuses...
Reading B

There is no such word as can’t Beinkensopp.
No kit sir.
Where is it?
Home sir.
What is it doing at home?
Not ironed sir.
Couldn’t you iron it?
Can’t sir.
Why not?
Bad hand sir.
Who usually does it?
Grandma, sir
Why couldn’t she do it?
Dead sir

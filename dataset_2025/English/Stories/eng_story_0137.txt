Once upon a time, humans and
animals lived together. They had
a disagreement about their
superiority. The humans
challenged Aakho and the
challenge came to be known
as Hekko.The people in the Mokokchung district of Nagaland
play a game named Hekko, which is a well-known
sport today.
Presently, it is played as a team game between
two teams: Aakho and Aami. The strongest people
in the village are identified through this game.
There are 11 players in each team. The toss
before the game decides which team will be called
Aami and which will be called Aakho.To play, a circle is first drawn, and the Aami
team has to stay within the circle by making a
human chain, while the Aakho team stays outside
the circle.
At first, two members of the Aakho team enter
the circle and try to push the Aami players outside
the circle. When an Aami player is pushed out of
the circle, he is out and cannot enter again.
The Aami team also tries to catch the players
of the Aakho team by surrounding them. When an
Aakho player is caught, he is not released until
he says “Joko” (surrender). When one player gets caught and surrenders, another player from the
Aakho team enters the circle. Whenever a team
gets a player of the opposite team out, it gains
points.
The game of Hekko gets over when one of the
following three things happens:
•	 All the members of the Aakho team
get caught.
•	 All the members of the Aami team
are pushed out of the circle.
•	 The time runs out.
The team with the
maximum points wins
the game.
The fastest player of
the Aami Team is
awarded the title of
“Khozuba” and
the strongest
player of the Aakho
team is awarded
the title
of “Khotiba”

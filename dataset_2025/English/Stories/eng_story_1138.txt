Once upon a time, certain workmen were busy building a temple.
When it was noon.
Ramrao, let’s go to the town for lunch.

Let’s hope no one touches that wedge while we are away.
Ok, Shamrao I’ll just put a wedge here and come.

Suddenly, a monkey arrived.
The monkey say - 
" What is this piece of wood doing here? I wonder what will happen if I pull it out. UGH! It’s tough. Out it came. Help!"

The gap closed in trapping the monkey’s tail.
The poor monkey cried in pain. So we should not meddle with things that are not concerned to us.

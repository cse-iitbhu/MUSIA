Papa began to make a wooden cart for Sona.
"I shall make one too," said Sona. Papa began to saw the wood.
"I shall cut some wood too," said Sona, stretching out her hand.
"Yes, of course, but first you must watch carefully," said Papa.  Next, Papa began to fix the wheels.
"I want to hammer the nails too," said Sona and picked up the hammer. "Yes, of course, but first watch carefully," said Papa. Soon the cart was ready. Papa was about to tie a string to it. "But where have I kept the pencil and thread?" Papa started looking for them. Papa was worried now. Sona began to laugh, "Shall I find them for you?" And, from behind Papa's ear, Sona drew out a pencil. From behind the other ear, the roll of thread. "I was watching you very carefully," Sona said to her father. "True! You have been a big help, Sona," said Papa, lovingly patting her on the head.

 I am Hammy the Hamster. I live with my mother Henrietta, my father Harry, my sister Hachi, and my brother Hal.
We live in South America and you can’t miss our home. It is the burrow under the trees that look like the letter H.
When we are out during the day, we are very careful so we aren’t caught.
Just like you, we like to play  and have fun.
We have fun running into the light and chasing our shadows on the leaves. Last night Hachi and I found this thing. When you pushed a button, it lit up like the sun.
Our cousins Lester, Larry, and Lorain live in the city. They are someone’s pet. They sent us this picture and said they had a lot of fun but missed playing with us.

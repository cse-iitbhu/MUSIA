One summer, an ant worked hard every day to gather food and store it safely for the winter. His friend, the grasshopper, however, laughed and said, “You work too hard! Relax!” The grasshopper spent all summer playing and singing instead of preparing.

But when winter came, the grasshopper was cold and hungry, while the ant stayed cozy in his home with more than enough food.

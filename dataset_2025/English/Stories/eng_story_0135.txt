Long ago, in France, a little boy named Louis Braille
was playing outside his home. He was three years
old. His father, a blacksmith, was working nearby.
Louis started playing with the tools around him.
Suddenly, a sharp tool pierced his eye.
He cried out in pain. Within a few
days, he became blind in one eye.
The other eye also got affected, and
he became totally blind.In 1819, Louis, who was ten years old, got
admission in the Royal Institute for Young Blind
Persons in Paris. He learnt letters by using wood,
cloth or pins arranged in pincushions. Around
this time, an army man named Capt. Charles
Barbier de la Serre had invented something called
‘Night Writing’. It was an alphabet of raised dots
and dashes that soldiers could ‘read’ with their
fingers in the dark. However, it was too difficult
and, therefore, not a success. But Louis, now a
teenager, became interested in it and simplified it.
He gave the world the Braille alphabet.Thus, a blind person taught
the world to see.
Braille is a method of reading
through touch. As you can see
in the figure, there is one Braille
symbol for each of the twenty-six
symbols (letters) of the English
alphabet.
But Braille requires more space. This is because
the letters cannot be written too close together.
Since Braille requires more space, a Braille book
is thicker than a regular printed book.

One summer, a grasshopper sang and danced while an ant worked hard, collecting food for winter. The grasshopper laughed at the ant, saying, “Why worry about winter? Enjoy the present!”

When winter arrived, the grasshopper had no food and was starving. He went to the ant’s house and begged for help. The kind ant shared some food but reminded the grasshopper, “Hard work today saves you from struggle tomorrow.”

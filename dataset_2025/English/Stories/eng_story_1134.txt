Soham and Reva are going to a shop with their
parents.
What a big shop!
Mother wanted to buy some things. Father
wanted to buy some things.
‘‘How about you, children? Do you want to buy
something on your own? Here’s some money.
You can use it to buy anything you like.’’
‘‘Shall we buy chocolates?’’
‘‘Shall we buy crayons?’’
‘‘Shall we buy a toy?’’
‘‘Please help us, mother.
What should we buy?’’
‘‘Well, you can buy something that will
finish up quickly, or, you can buy something
that will last long. You can buy something
made by others, or, you can buy things and
make something yourself.’’ 


‘‘That’s a good idea. Let’s buy things and
make new things with them.’’
 Soham and Reva picked up some
things. They went to the counter.
‘‘We want to buy this paper, glue and
colours. How much is it?’’
‘‘Ninety-five rupees in all.’’
‘‘Here’s the money. A hundred rupees.’’
‘‘Thank you. I must give you five rupees
back. Here it is.’’
‘‘That’s right. Thank you.’’

An old man lived with his four sons
in a village. The old man was worried.
His sons were always quarrelling
with each other. They would never
agree on any point. The old man had
tried telling them many times to avoid
fighting. But his sons would not listen
to him. They would fight for everything.
 One day, he called his four sons. He
gave them a small bundle of sticks, and
asked them to break the bundle into two.
“It’s so easy,” said the eldest son. He took
the bundle and tried to break it. He was
surprised that the sticks in the bundle
remained unbroken. He used more force.
He tried again and again. But the bundle
of sticks did not break. He gave up.
Then his brothers tried to break the bundle of sticks. They tried
hard but they too could not succeed.
Their father smiled and asked them to untie the bundle. Now the
sticks were separated. He gave each brother a single stick and asked
them to break it. Each of the sons took a stick in hand. In no time, the
sticks were bent and broken.
 “A single stick is easily broken. If
four sticks come together, it is impossible
to break them. If you are united, help
each other and live in friendship, you
will be stronger than any enemy. But if
you are divided among yourselves and
keep fighting, you will be as weak as the single stick in that bundle. Remember, united we stand, divided we fall.” said
the old man, giving his sons a meaningful
look.
This time the brothers learnt a lesson.
They stopped fighting with each other.
They started to work together as a team
and that really helped them.

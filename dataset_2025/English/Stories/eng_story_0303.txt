Once, there was a hare who was best friends with a tortoise. The hare was very proud of how fast he could run, so one day, he challenged the tortoise to a race. The tortoise agreed, even though everyone thought he was way too slow to win. The race began, and the hare raced so fast that he was far ahead of the tortoise.

Feeling confident, the hare decided to take a nap under a tree while the tortoise kept going, step by step. When the hare woke up, he was shocked to see the tortoise crossing the finish line. The tortoise had won the race!

Baby Parrot lived in a nest with Mummy
and a big white egg. ‘‘I’m going to find
some food,’’ said Mummy one day.

‘‘You must look after the egg until I return.’’
Baby Parrot watched the egg for a very
long time. She moved it around to make
sure it was comfortable. She wrapped her
wings around it to make sure it was warm.
‘‘ I’m very good at looking after eggs,’’ she
thought.

Just then, she heard the monkeys
playing in the trees. Baby Parrot tried to
call like a monkey, too. She peered over the
edge of the nest and laughed at their games.
Suddenly Baby Parrot remembered the
egg. She looked around and gulped. It was
broken. Mummy would be angry! But when
Mummy returned, she wasn’t angry at all.

‘‘Don’t worry,’’ Mummy said, as a little
parrot popped out of the broken eggshell.
‘‘The egg has hatched while I was away.
Now you’ve got a new baby sister to play
with!’’

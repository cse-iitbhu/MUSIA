Holidays are sweetened by ripe mangoes from trees And cooled by the never-ending evening breeze. Holidays are a play in which I'm the lead Lying in bed awake, yet pretending to be asleep.
Holidays are an island where I am free An island that's been made just for me! Holidays are a gift coupon, life is study-free!
With a bonus of playtime. Whoopee!
Holiday are sweet and sour like tasty treats, And as thrilling as playing hide and seek!
Holidays jingle like loose change in my pocket, Vroom! But they go by too fast, like a rocket. Holidays, oh these weak-hearted fools Are a slave to the calendar and its rules.
Perhaps, holidays are like my favourite toffee!
Oho! But they melt away oh-so-very quickly.

Tarun was a mediocre student. His grades could barely satisfy his parents. And, he was
not a good singer, dancer, painter or even an actor. He always thought of himself as the
black sheep of the family. His elder brother, who was pursuing a degree in engineering
from a reputed college always made the family proud. But Tarun was never good at
anything like that.
However, he was blessed with the strength of a great athlete; he was an excellent runner.
He would run for hours, be it day or night. Whenever he felt sad and lonely, he exhausted
himself by running, thus releasing all his pent-up emotions. At times he would miss his
school bus and would then run to the school, which was five miles away from his
home! He just had one dream- to become the fastest runner in the world. Tarun did not
know how to achieve his dream. On one hand, his parents hated his running and wanted
him to concentrate more on his studies, which he never did. On the other hand, he
belonged to a middle class family, and Tarun knew that to achieve his dream, he needed
an intensive training, the amount which was well beyond his family’s reach.
When Tarun failed in his terminal examinations, his father was very angry with him. His
friends too made fun of him. It was a day he wanted to erase from his life and so he
took to running. He ran all around the park. The sun beat down to check his rage but
nothing could stop Tarun. After about an hour, he was fully exhausted and his fury
having subsided, he threw himself on a bench and started to pant.
Suddenly he heard a voice. “What is it, son?”
Tarun looked to his left and there sat a man of about sixty.
“I failed in two subjects,” Tarun replied in a depressed tone.
The man smiled sympathetically and said, “Life is full of ups and downs, boy. By the
way I am Ram Narayan, and you are one of the best runners I have ever seen.”
“Ram Narayan? Raaa…m…Narayan! Are you the same Ram Narayan who won an
Olympic medal in the 400 metre race in the 1960s?” Tarun could not hide his excitement.
“Yes,” pat came the reply. Tarun was dazzled.

“Son, I have been watching you for the past 45 minutes,” continued Ram Narayan,
“and, I see a good future in you.”
Tarun could not help but blush.
“All you need to do is keep that passion burning in you and never give up. Have you
joined some training school?”
Tarun’s smile turned to distress. “A training school is very expensive, Sir, and I am
unemployed,” said Tarun, feeling happy that he could joke even in these circumstances.
But Ram Narayan seemed pretty serious, “I can train you if you want, but I have one
condition.”
“What condition?” Tarun’s voice showed a sense of urgency.
“There is a race on the Children’s Day at the Nehru Stadium. Children of your age are
competing there. If you win that race, I will start training you,” said Ram Narayan.
“That is no big deal,’ thought Tarun. “I will, I will Sir!”, he heard himself say with
complete conviction.
“Fine, boy! It is my job to get you entry in the race and remember yours to win it. Tell
me, what is your name?”, asked Ram Narayan.
“Tarun…Tarun Kapoor, Sir.”
“Tarun, I will meet you here after five days to give you your participation card. All the
best,” said Ram Narayan and left.
The next day brought a new ray of hope. Tarun got up early, had milk and before his
mother could finish her query on what he was up to, he ran out and went to the Nehru
Stadium to check the details of the race. He was very happy indeed.
Tarun started preparing with zeal. Every day he would get up at four in the morning and
run ten miles. In the evenings, he would time himself according to the 1000 metre
distance prescribed by the competition. He wanted everything to be perfect. He also
wanted someone to back him up and so he told his mother everything.
Tarun practiced vigorously for five days, and then met Ram Narayan to collect his
participation card. Tarun gazed at the piece of paper which meant so much to him. No
matter what, he had to win this race. He wanted to show his father that he was not really
the black sheep of the family and that; he could be good at something at least.

Then came November 14. After taking the blessings of his mother, Tarun pedalled away
to the stadium. There was a huge crowd waiting to go inside. Tarun entered the office
where a sign board read ‘Participants only’ with his heart beating faster every second.
Inside, there were about fifty participants waiting for the race to begin.
Someone patted him on the shoulders. “Hello, Tarun!” It was Ram Narayan. “All the
best!” he said affectionately.
Tarun smiled but did not say a word.
All the participants lined up, each one hoping to win the race. Each one of them had his
family and friends on the stands to cheer for them. To his amazement, Tarun saw his
mother in the stands. The fear in his eyes changed to confidence.
The whistle blew and all the participants started off with all their might. They were all
determined to be the winner of the race. In the lead was the fastest of them all, Tarun.
Seeing himself ahead of everybody, Tarun felt very proud of himselfloser, today and so without wasting a second, he got up to run once more. Being quick
Tarun overtook a few kids ahead of him. But as fate would have it, he slipped again.
What was happening to him? He could not bear it. He looked into the crowd and saw
his mother. She was saying something to him: ‘Get up son, get up and run.’
So Tarun got up once again. He was among the last few. But he did not give up. Once
more he overtook some children. Since he was fretting a little too much, he fell a third
time!
Tears were rolling down his cheeks. How will he get into Ram Narayan’s training
school now? How will he prove to his parents that he was talented? He was the last kid
on the track now.
He turned his eyes towards the stands. Then he heard Ram Narayan screaming from
somewhere, “ Come on, Tarun, run!” And so he got up a third time. This twelve year
old determined boy, who was last on the track, got up and ran with all the strength he
had.
The crowd was cheering for Pawan, the boy who had won the race. But to Tarun’s
surprise, there was louder applause when he crossed the finishing line last. The audience
cheered for his determination and his valor for never giving up.
He bowed his head with shame and said to Ram Narayan, “I am sorry, Sir, I lost.”
“No, son, to me you have won the toughest race, the race of your life. You got up and
started afresh each time you fell. You are a real-life hero. Your training starts tomorrow.”
Tarun could not believe his ears. Tears filled his eyes again. He smiled at his mother
who hugged him and said, “You are the best son in the world.”Tarun was a mediocre student. His grades could barely satisfy his parents. And, he was

There was a monkey named Manku.
Manku lived in a cave.
A lake was near the cave.
Ducky, the drake and his sister
Lucky lived in the lake.
Jin and Jenny, the cranes lived near
the lake.
All of them were Manku’s friends.
They loved to play together.
One day Manku became very happy.
“ Oh ! Tomorrow is Sunday and Sunday is my birthday.
Ducky, Lucky, Jin and Jenny will come to say,
Happy Birthday”, thought Manku.
Soon it was Sunday.
Manku waited for a long time for hours and hours.
But no one came. So he felt very sad.
Manku went to the lake. But no one
was there.
So sadly Manku came back to his cave.
Manku was surprised to see the cake
on the table.
“Wow! A cake!” said Manku.
Ducky, Lucky, Jin and Jenny came out and shouted, ‘‘ Happy Birthday
to you… Happy Birthday dear, Manku.”
“ We were waiting to give you a surprise”, all said.
“ I baked cake for you”, said Jin.
“ I bought you some grapes,” said Jenny.
“ And we have made this table for you”, said Ducky and Lucky.

“ It’s really a surprise for me. Thanks, my dear friends. You all are
really great ! I love you all,” said Manku.
Then they all danced together.

For a week our ship had been caught in a terrible storm. The
crew was worn out. In the cabin where I prayed with my
family, we heard a cry of “Land! Land!” and felt the ship
strike something. I rushed to the deck.
There, I saw the last boat push off, loaded with sailors.
“Wait!” I cried, “What of my family?” But they rowed away
and never looked back.
I returned to my family, trying to hide my fears.
Tomorrow, if the wind and
waves die down, we should be
able to reach shore.
We must find some food
and have a good supper.After a meal,
the children
slept soundly
through the
night.
At dawn we
were thankful
to see blue sky
above us.
We stood
together on the
deck.It will soon be
calm enough for
swimming.
That’s fine for you, but
what about the rest of us?
Why not build a raft?A raft would not be
safe, but we must
think of something.
Could we each get into
a big tub and float? I’ve
sailed on the pond at
home like that.
A great idea,
my child!We soon found four large barrels and
went to work.
While I saw the barrels in
two, try to find some long,
thin boards.In smooth water, I
think this little boat
will do us very well!The next morning we got together all the supplies we could carry
and made ready to set out. Many useful things had to be left behind
at this time.
We have left food for
the larger animals on
board. Why not take the
chickens with us?
If we don’t find food
for them, they can be
food for us!We freed the ducks, geese,
and pigeons.
They’ll reach shore
before we do!Hoping for the best, we set off.We followed the ducks through a small opening in the rocks where a stream
flowed into the sea. We were in a small bay from which we were able to land.
Saved from the sea! Our first act must be to thank
God for our escape!
Next we set up a tent.Now, my good wife, perhaps
you will make us a meal from
the dried soup we saved.Next morning, Mrs. Robinson cooked us a breakfast of bread and soup. Then Fritz
went to look around the island. He returned and made his report.
All in its time, son. Did
you see any of our
shipmates?
I went across the stream, it’s
beautiful there, If we could
bring the cow from the ship,
there’s plenty of good green
grassNot a sign. But the shore
is full of things we can use
from the wreckDinner is ready, but how are we
to eat? No plates and - spoons
- and we can’t lift the pot.Perhaps clam
shells would
do?Quickly, we found some shells and cleaned them. Soon we were dipping into
our dinner.
We will take one of the dogs. The other
will stay here to keep you safe.
Below a waterfall,
we found our way
across.
Careful, my
son!
And you too,
Papa.
We pushed on
for three hours
through country
with many
trees. We cut
our way through
a patch of
reeds.
Oh, Papa, this must be sugarcane!
How good the juice tastes! Let’s
take some back for the others.
Of course,
Fritz!We came to
some palm
trees and found
a troop of
monkeys.
I will throw
stones at them,
but will not try
to hit them.
They will copy me and
throw coconuts back at us!
How else could we reach
fresh coconuts?
Very smart,
Papa!We returned home with our finds
to a happy family.
We found a good meal waiting
for us.
And I killed the big
bird with a stick.
We have been busy too.
The boys caught the fish.
Look! A monkey!
Where did Fritz find
him?
He has some big,
funny round things
too. And lotsSoon after dark we went to bed. We were awakened from sleep by barking
dogs and the squawks of our chickens.
Jackals!
Our brave dogs were fighting off twelve jackals. Four were already
dead. Our guns soon drove off the rest.
Yes, you are
brave dogs!
They have been hurt. If
they had spiked collars,
they would have been
saved from wild animals
jumping for their necks.
We returned to bed. This time we
slept until morning. We must return to the ship
before bad weather comes.
We will save the animals and
take with us anything else we
can use.
That’s a good
idea.

One day, a hungry dog found a bone and happily carried it in his mouth. As he walked over a bridge, he saw his reflection in the river below. Thinking it was another dog with a bigger bone, he barked to scare it away.

But as he opened his mouth, his bone fell into the water, and he lost it forever.

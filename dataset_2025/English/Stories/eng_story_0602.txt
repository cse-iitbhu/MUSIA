Cody Cat, what's the problem? 
Well, it just never stops raining in the Cretaceous period! 
Is that such a problem? 
Look how wet I am! You know cats hate water, right? 
Yes... 
And there's mud everywhere! It's going to take AGES to lick it off! 
So what are you going to do, Cody Cat? 
I'm going to code! 
How are you going to do it?

I'm going to say IF it rains for more than 12 hours, THEN stop rain. 
if (rain > 12 hours) { 
stop rain; 
} 
Wow, Cody Cat! You did it! I can even see the sun now!

But... Cody Cat? 
Yeah? 
Have you noticed something...? 
What? 
Umm... Now it's getting hot! 
Well, maybe a little... 
You have fur. You must feel it more than me! 
Maybe you're right. 
What do you think is happening? It feels like the temperature is rising! We don't want to cause a dangerous heatwave! 
Oh no... 
What are you going to do, Cody Cat? 
I'm going to code! 
How are you going to do it?

I'm going to say IF the barometer reading goes higher than heatwave temperature, THEN decrease temperature. 
if (reading > heatwave temperature) { 
decrease temperature; 
} 
Great, Cody Cat! I'm feeling a bit cooler now!

Now I think we should start exploring... 
Uh... Cody Cat? 
What? 
Can you see lightning over there? 
Oh yes! Wow, there's a lot of it! 
It seems to be coming closer... 
Say that again? I can't hear you over the thunder! 
What's happening, Cody Cat? This seems like a glitch. I've never seen so many thunderstorms, ever! 
Hmm... yes. Yes, I think it's a thunderstorm glitch. 
Can you fix it? 
Of course I can fix it! 
And how are you going to do that, Cody Cat? 
I'm going to code! 
How are you going to do it?

I'm going to say IF the thunderstorm is frequent, THEN set the storm timer to less frequent. 
if (thunderstorm frequent) { 
set storm timer to less frequent; 
} 
Wow, Cody Cat! That did it! I can hear you again!

Anyway, let's go and check out the triceratops, I really want to see them... 
Uh... Cody Cat? 
What? 
Have you noticed something? 
What? 
Well, that lake for example. It's frozen solid. 
Oh, yes... it is. 
And it's snowing! 
Argh! The Cretaceous is supposed to be tropical! 
What do you think has happened, Cody Cat? 
Err... I might just have triggered an Ice Age... 
So what are you going to do, Cody Cat? 
Well, I guess I'm going to code! 
How are you going to do it?

I'm going to say IF Ice Age is activated, THEN restore normal climate. 
if (Ice Age activated) { 
restore normal climate; 
} 
Thank goodness, Cody Cat! Those Triceratops would have turned into 
Icy Pops!

Shh! I've just seen a whole group of Spinosaurus tiptoe past! 
Wow, Cody. That's really cool! 
Yes! If we just follow them... 
Oh no, Cody! What just happened?! 
Help! I'm spinning in the air! 
Oh no! And look over towards the horizon. It's a whole group of tornados! What could possibly have caused that? 
I suppose it's never good to play too much with the weather... 
Watch out Cody Cat! You don't want it to whisk you away! 
I guess I'm just going to have to code! Fast! 
How are you going to do it?

I'm going to say IF a tornado is detected, THEN dissipate tornado. 
if (tornado detected) { dissipate tornado; 
} 
Phew, Cody Cat! I'm glad it put you back on the ground, and not in that giant conifer!

Right! Now we're back on the ground. 
Now what was it that you wanted to do? 
Literally all I want to see is a triceratops.... I think I can hear a herd. 
Oh good! I want to see a triceratops too! 
Just around this tree, and... Argh! 
What's up, Cody Cat? 
Well they're just there. But I can't see them! 
Why can't you see them? 
This big, thick, heavy mist has just swooped in! I can hear them, but I can't see a thing! 
Maybe the tornado brought it in... 
Maybe... 
So what are you going to do, Cody Cat? 
So I'm going to code, of course! 
How are you going to do it?

I'm going to say IF fog persists, THEN clear fog. 
if (fog persists) { clear fog; 
} 
Wow, Cody Cat! We can see them 
ALL now!

Except... 
What is it, Cody? 
Well... they can see us too. 
Oh. Do you think a cat is delicious to a triceratops? 
Oh no! They eat plants! 
What's the problem, then? 
Have you noticed the size of their feet? 
Are you worried their feet will be smelly? 
No! I'm worried they're going to tread on us! 
So what are you going to do, Cody Cat? 
I'm going to code, of course! 
How are you going to do it?

I'm going to say IF triceratops foot lifts above me, THEN the triceratops will pause and step back gently. 
if (triceratops foot above cat) { pause; step back gently; 
} 
Wow, Cody Cat! I do believe you've invented the world's first prehistoric protection bubble!

So, are you happy? 
Oh yes, look at all those beautiful triceratops! They're magnificent! 
They really are, Cody Cat. 
I love the way they're sparkling in the sunshine, beneath all the rainbows... 
Rainbows? 
Yes! Look at all the rainbows in the sky! 
There must be a hundred of them! Don't you think that's a bit too many... scientifically? 
Is it? 
I've never seen more than two or three at once. 
Argh catnip! It must be a glitch. A rainbow glitch. 
So what are you going to do, Cody Cat? 
I'm going to code! 
How are you going to do it?

Well, rainbows come when there's rain. But there's not even any rain right now. 
I'm going to say IF rainbows appear with no rain, THEN remove the rainbow. 
if (rainbow appears without rain) { remove rainbow 
} 
You did it, Cody Cat. I guess that's better for the environment. 
Though they were REALLY PRETTY...

But wait a second Cody Cat! 
Cody Cat? 
Where are you, Cody Cat? 
Sorry! Did you feel that earthquake? It opened up a big crack in the earth! 
I fell in!

I know how to fix it! 
if (earthquake detected) { 
deactivate seismic 
activity; 
}

Phew, Cody Cat! You saved the time machine! 
Let's hop in and go back home. 
After all these weather adventures, we don't want to be here when the giant asteroid hits!

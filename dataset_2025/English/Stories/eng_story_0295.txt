One day, MOUSE found a very big bun.
"I will take this bun into my house," he said. He pushed the bun from the back. It did not move. He pushed it from the front. The bun did not move. He pushed it from the right, the bun did not move.  He ran around the bun and pushed it from the left, but it still did not move. Hmm... I will tie a string around the bun and pull it into my house.
Mouse ran to the house and got a string, but it was too short. He went back and got a longer string.
He tied the bun with the long string, then pulled and pulled but it did not move. Mouse sat down and ate a little bit of the bun.
It was very good. He ate a little more, then a little more, and a little more till the bun became smaller and smaller. He pushed the bun, it rolled right into his house. Mouse was very happy. The bun was safely in his house.
But he had eaten so much bun that his stomach had become so... SO... big. Mouse pushed and pushed himself but he could not get into his house. Mouse sat outside his door holding his stomach and groaned, "I should not have eaten so much bun.
I should have shared it with someone."

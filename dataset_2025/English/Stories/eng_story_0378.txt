The Thirsty Crow 
One hot day, a crow was very thirsty. He looked for water here and there, but he could not find it. 
After a long time, he saw a pot. But there was very little water in it and the crow could not reach the water. 
He thought of a plan. He picked up some pebbles one by one, and dropped them into the pot. 
The water came up to the top. He drank the v and flew away happily. 
He was a clever crow

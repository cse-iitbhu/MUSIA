Mittu was a parrot. A green
parrot with a red beak. One day
Mittu was flying. He loved to fly.
He looked down. He saw a big
yellow mango on a tree. Mittu liked
mangoes. “I want to eat that yellow
mango,”
he said. He flew down to the tree.
“Caw, caw, go away. This is my
tree,” said a voice. Mittu looked
up.
He saw a big black crow. “Caw,
caw, go, go,”the crow shouted.
He had a very loud voice. Mittu
was afraid of the crow.
He flew away.
Mittu saw a red balloon. It was
under a tree. He had an idea.
He picked up the red balloon.
He was careful not to burst it.
He flew to the mango tree.
The crow was sitting on the
tree. Mittu went behind the tree.
He pecked the balloon with
his red beak. “
Pop!” The balloon burst.
It made a loud noise.
“Caw!” said the crow.
And he fell off the tree.
“Caw, caw, a big gun is
after me,” said the crow. He
flew away.
He never came back to the
treeMittu came to the tree.
He ate the big yellow mango.
“Yummy yummy, what a nice
mango!” he said. He was very
happy.
Clever Mittu!

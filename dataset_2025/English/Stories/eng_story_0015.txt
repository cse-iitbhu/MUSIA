Well, the next thing Alice found was a
little cake; with the words 'EAT ME' marked
on it. So, she sat there and ate it up. And then,
guess what happened to her ! She grew and
grew and grew. Taller than she was before!
Taller than any child! Taller than any grown
up person. Taller and taller! (Just look at the
picture.) Which Alice would you like the best.
A tiny Alice, no larger than a doll or a very tall Alice touching the ceiling of the
roof ? Poor Alice!
What do you think ? Was she
happy to find herself tall enough to
reach the table and get the key to
unlock the door or to be too small to
get through the door? Well, she could
do that; but do you think she could get out of
that tiny door? She could only just manage to
lie flat, put her head down on the floor and
look out through the door.
Poor child! She sat down on the floor
and wept bitterly. She wept and wept and
wept. Her tears ran down like a river and very
soon there was a large pool of tears in the room.
Suddenly, the white rabbit entered the
room. He was dressed up to go somewhere.
He had a little fan and gloves in one hand and
a watch in the other hand. He was looking at
his watch, muttering to himself, ......"I am late,
Oh, I am
late!" He did not notice Alice. Alice
requested him, "Please sir, ........"
 The white rabbit was so frightened on
hearing the voice, that he dropped his fan
and gloves and ran away through the door.
Alice took a deep sigh, took up the fan,
and began to fan herself. And lo!.... What
happened ! With the movement of the fan she
got smaller and smaller and in a minute she was just about the size of a mouse. In
the pool of tears, a mouse was
already swimming. Alice was also
swimming with him.
They came out of the pool and
both were wet. There were other
creatures in that swimming pool
like a dodo, a duck and an eaglet.
Alice heard them talking about a
party in the garden outside, and she
thought.....

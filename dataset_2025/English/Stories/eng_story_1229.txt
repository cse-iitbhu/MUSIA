I am Aarush.
This is my cat Manu.
I have a head, two eyes and two ears.
Manu also has a head, two eyes and two ears.
Manu has a tail.
I don’t have a tail.
I can run and jump.
Manu can run and jump, too.
I like milk. Manu likes milk, too.
I say Hi. Manu says Meow.
Manu likes to run a lot.
Ohh…! What is Manu running after?
Is it running after a rat? … No it isn’t.
Is it running after a ball? … No it isn’t.
Is it running after a butterfly? … No it isn’t.
Ohh…! It’s running after me!
I like to play with Manu. Manu also likes to play with me.
I love Manu and Manu loves me

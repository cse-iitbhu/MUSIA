We packed our bags.
We went to the bus-stand.
Our bus was ready.
We boarded the bus.
We found our seats.
Our seat numbers were 11, 12, 13,
14. I sat near the window. I saw some
hills. I saw some trees passing by too.

I saw markets full of people.

We reached Aajjeeâ€™s home after four hours. She
welcomed us and hugged us. We love our Aajjee.
We love our Aajoba too.

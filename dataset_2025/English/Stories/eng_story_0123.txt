Once, the Maharaja of Travancore
ordered a grand dinner in his palace. In the
afternoon before the dinner, the Maharaja
entered the kitchen to survey the dishes that
had been prepared for the feast.
“What are you going to do with those
vegetable scraps?” he asked the cook,
pointing to the basket of scraps near the
cook. The cook replied, “They are waste. We
will throw them away.”
“You cannot waste all these bits and
pieces of vegetables. Find a way to use them,”
the Maharaja commanded sternly and
walked away.
The cook was in
a fix and kept
staring at the
vegetable scraps for
some time. Suddenlyan idea flashed across his
mind.
H e t o o k a l l t h e
vegetable bits, washed
them and cleaned them
well.
Then he cut them into
long strips. He put them in
a huge pot and placed it on
the fire to cook. Next, he
g r o u n d s o m e f r e s h
coconut, green chillies and
garlic together. He added
this paste and some salt to the cooking vegetables.
A tempting smell started coming from the pot.
Now he whipped some curd and added it to the curry.
He also poured a few spoonfuls of coconut oil and
decorated the dish with curry leaves.
Lo and behold! The new dish was ready.
The cook served this new dish to the guests that
evening.
Everyone was eager to know the name of
the new dish. The cook thought and
thought. Then a name came to
his mind. He named it
(uh-vi-ul).
became famous all
over Kerala and is now one of the dishes in
a traditional Kerala feast. And imagine, it
all came from a basket of waste!

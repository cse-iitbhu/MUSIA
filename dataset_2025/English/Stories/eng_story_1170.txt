Once upon a time there lived a monkey and an elephant in a
forest. One day, they started fighting.

Elephant says - I am very strong. I am good
at carrying heavy logs.  

Monkey says - Ha... Ha... Ha... ! But I am very
quick. I am good at jumping
from one tree
to another.

Owl says - Who...Who...Who is fighting loudly? I want to sleep.

Monkey - Sorry ! Very sorry!
Please tell us. Who is
better ? The elephant
or I? He is strong but
I am quick.

Owl - Don’t worry. We will find out.
There is a mango tree just across the river.
Go and bring one sweet, ripe mango from there.
Then I will tell you who is better.


Then strolled the elephant and hopped the monkey to the river bank. 

Monkey - Oh! I am afraid to
cross the river!
Water is very
deep. I am
going back.

Elephant - Don’t worry
dear! Jump on
my back and
we will cross
the river.


Both of them crossed the river. There was a mango tree with sweet,
yellow, ripe mangoes but they were on high branches. 

Elephant - Oh! No!I can’t reach.
How can I give
the mango to
the owl?
 Monkey - That’s easy
Let me do it.

They came back to the wise, old owl and gave
him the mango. He was very happy.

Owl - Now you tell me!
Who is better?

Elephant and monkey
forgot their fight and
the owl forgot its nap

Elephant - I am strong. The monkey is quick and you
are wise. All of us are good at something.
What about you my friends?

Monkey - What are you good at ?

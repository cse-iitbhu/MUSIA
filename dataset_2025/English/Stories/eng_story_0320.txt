Once upon a time, there was a boy who had a duty to look after a flock of sheep. The used to lie for his fun.

One day he started shouting, “Wolf, Wolf, Wolf”, on hearing this villager ran towards him for his help.

But when the villagers reached he was laughing on them as there was no wolf.

He was lying and making a fool out of the villagers. This continued for some days.

And finally, one day, a wolf really came and shouted again, nobody came and as a result, the boy was killed by the wolf.

There was no one to blame but him.

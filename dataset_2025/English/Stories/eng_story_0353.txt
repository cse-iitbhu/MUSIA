The Watermelon Wonder of Prince Percy
Once upon a time, in a land so grand, lived Prince Percy with a green thumbed hand. He planted watermelons all around, in the sunshine and on fertile ground. "Oh, the juicy, red delight!" he sang in sheer delight. Birds with feathers bright and fine, perched on vines in a sweetened line. "Caw! Squawk!" they sang in tune, "Prince Percy's melons will be gone soon!" In the shadows, monkeys giggle, with tails that twirl and always wiggle. "Ooh ooh, aah aah!" they play and prance, eyeing watermelons with a sneaky glance. Squirrels chatter in the treetops high, with clever eyes and tails that fly. "Chitter-chatter, here we go!" soon, they're munching melons below. Prince Percy heard the cheeky crew, and thought, "Oh, what am I to do?" But then an idea popped in his head, that made his cheeks turn rosy red. With a flourish, he declared with flair, “A feast for all, I do declare! Come one, come all, it’s snack-time fun, with watermelons for everyone!” Birds, monkeys, and squirrels came together, in the grove regardless of the weather. They pecked and nibbled, laughed and chewed, all bellies happy, and spirits renewed. Prince Percy smiled and took a bite, "This was worth the fruitful fight!" he thought of tricks and pranks they played, but in the end, a friend he made. "From this day forth," Percy cried, "a watermelon bond we won't divide!" With newfound friends, both big and small, the finest summer festival of all. And so it was, in lands so sweet, birds and squirrels and monkeys meet. From far and wide, young and old, to share in tales that are never told. Happily ever after, the prince and crew, danced to the rhythm of the morning dew. Watermelons brought them close you see, in the garden of harmony! The end, or is it just the start? Of fruits and friendships, with a happy heart. Percy's garden, so lush and grand, where watermelons grow for every hand!

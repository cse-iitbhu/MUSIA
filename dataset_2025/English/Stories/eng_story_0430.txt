A poor woodcutter lived near a river. One day, while chopping wood, his axe slipped from his hands and fell into the river. He sat by the riverbank, sad and helpless. Suddenly, a fairy appeared and asked, “Why are you crying?”

The woodcutter told her about his lost axe. The fairy dived into the river and brought out a golden axe. “Is this yours?” she asked. The woodcutter shook his head. The fairy dived again and brought a silver axe. Again, the woodcutter refused. Finally, she brought his old iron axe, and he happily said, “Yes, this is mine!”

Impressed by his honesty, the fairy rewarded him with all three axes.

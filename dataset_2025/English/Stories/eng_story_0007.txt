Once upon a time, there was a
little girl called Alice. One day she
had a very strange and interesting
dream. Would you like to hear about
her dream ?
(Well, this was the very first
thing that happened in her dream)
A white rabbit came running by,
in a great hurry. As it passed Alice,
it stopped and took his watch out of his
pocket.
(Have you ever seen a Rabbit that
had a watch ?)
“Oh, dear, oh dear ! I’ll be too late”,
said the rabbit.
Alice heard and watched the
rabbit and ran after it. She wanted
to see where the rabbit was going.
She followed the rabbit and tumbled
down into the rabbit-hole. There she
fell fast asleep(Can you imagine how safe and cosy
it was!)
After sometime, she suddenly woke
up, jumped on to her feet and ran after
the rabbit again. But there was no
rabbit ! She found herself in a big hall
with doors all around it. All
the doors were locked. So,
she couldn’t get out of the
hall.
There was a little
table in the middle of the
hall. A little key was lying
on the table.
She picked up
the key and
tried to unlock
the doors. She
tried to open
them one by one and when she came to the last little
door, it got opened !She could bend down to just peep
through the door and she saw a beautiful
garden outside. But she could not go out
through that tiny door. She became very
sad. She locked the door and went back
to the table. She kept the key there. She
saw a small bottle with a label ‘DRINK
ME’. She tasted it, and do you know
what happened to her?She got smaller and smaller, and smaller... till at last she was just the size
of a little doll.
She was happy now. She ran to the door. But it was locked. Then she ran
back. But, alas ! (Why did she become sad ?)

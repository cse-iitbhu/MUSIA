Nani lost her glasses and she
could not find them!
Nani keeps losing her
glasses.
“Where did I keep them?”
she always asks.
So she needs me to be her eyes, to find her own eyes!
Sometimes her glasses are in the bathroom,
sometimes on her bed, and sometimes on her head.
I looked everywhere. In all the usual places -
on her head, in the
bathroom, inside
the cupboard, and on the bed. I also
looked under her favourite chair and on
the dining table. No glasses. No luck!
I asked her what she had done the
whole day. She said, “I did nothing much
today. Some cooking in the
kitchen and some work in the garden. Then I spent
time in reading and knitting.”


Now, I had many clues. I quickly looked
around new places in the house. Aha! I found
the missing glasses! The glasses were wrapped
in the knitting yarn.

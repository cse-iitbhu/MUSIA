Sundari was a big red,
white and blue kite. When
Bobby made her, she smiled
at him.
“You are beautiful and I
will call you Sundari,” he
said.
One day, Bobby took
Sundari to the fair.
The band was playing and everyone was smiling.
A merry-go-round was playing a happy little tune.
It was carrying lots of boys and girls round and round on
its wooden animals.
Bobby looked for an
open space where he
could run and fly his
kite. Sundari looked
too.
Out in the grass ran
Bobby, holding up his
kite as high as he
could.Puff! The wind came along. Sundari started to fly up! But
she could not go very high. A little dog was holding on to her
long tail. It was in his mouth.
Bobby shooed the dog away. “We’ll try again,” Bobby
said.
This time Sundari leaped up in the air. She tugged hard.
Oh, how she wanted Bobby to let go of her string! She gave a
big tug. Bobby had to let her go.
“Wheee!” cried Sundari. “Now I can fly as high as I please!”
And away she went. She flew up, up, up in the air.

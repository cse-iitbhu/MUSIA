Rahish had a pet.
It was a black hen.
Her name was Toto.

Toto lived in a coop.
Toto was a very smart hen.
Rahish used to give food to her everyday and
played with her.
They became good friends.
When Toto laid an egg,
she used to make a ‘special’ sound “Kok-kok-kok”.

Then Rahish came out and fed Toto and took
the egg for him.
One night Rahish was sleeping in the bed.
He heard the special sound of Toto “ Kok-kokkok”. Rahish came out from the house.
Toto ran to Rahish and pecked his leg.
Rahish looked around to see what happened.
He smelt something burning. 


“Oh! My God! The coop is on fire”, he shouted. The coop was in a
mess.
Rahish ran to the tap of water and took the pipe.
Then he showered the water and put out the fire

Then, Rahish bent and picked up Toto.
“You smart hen, my dear friend!
You have saved my farm”, said Rahish.
Toto happily replied to Rahish, “Kok……….
Kok……..Kok….”

Once upon a time, there was a
farmer who liked fruits. So, he
decided to grow fruits on his
land. He worked hard to grow
a variety of fruits. With hard
work and care, the trees grew
well. He took special care to
grow grapes and watermelons in
a small corner of his farm.
When the fruits were all ripe and
ready to be eaten, the farmer decided
to gift the best fruit to the king.
Then his wife said, “This year, the
best fruits on our farm are the
watermelons and the grapes.” The
farmer thought about it and said,
“Since it is a long journey to the
palace, I shall take the grapes
as watermelons are too
heavy.” So, he put bunches
of grapes in a basket and
walked to the king’s palace.
The farmer reached the palace. He told the
palace guard that he
had brought a gift for the
King. The palace guard
then took him to the
royal garden. The farmer
saw the King playing
with the princess. So, he
quietly kept the basket
full of grapes in front of
him and sat down.
When the King sat down to rest, the
guard brought the basket of grapes to the
King. The guard pointed to the farmer and
told the King that the grapes were a gift
from the farmer. The King saw the farmer.
The King was still in a playful mood. He
took a bunch of grapes from the basket.
He plucked out one grape and popped it
into his mouth. Then he plucked another
grape and threw it playfully at the farmer.
When the grape hit the farmer’s forehead, he
said, “Thank God!”
The King was surprised! He threw a grape again.
The farmer again said, “Thank God! I am blessed!”
The King asked the farmer, “Why are you
thanking God when I am throwing grapes at you?”
The wise farmer replied with a smile, “O mighty
King! I had grown the best grapes and watermelons
on my farm. I chose the grapes to gift to you. Imagine
if I had brought watermelons! Indeed, God is great!”

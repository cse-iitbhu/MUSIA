I think mice are rather nice.
Their tails are long,
their faces small,
They haven’t any
chins at all.
Their ears are pink,
their teeth are white,
They run about
the house at night.
They nibble things,
they shouldn’t touch
And no one seems
to like them much.
But I think mice are rather nice.

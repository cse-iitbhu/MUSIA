Una's Tremendous Time-Travel Treasure
Once in a town, so sunny and fair, lived a girl named Una with shiny red hair. Her eyes were as bright as the morning sun, and her giggles could turn any frown to fun! Una loved to explore, she loved to roam. She felt the whole world was her wondrous home. On a magical morning, with a curious heart, she stumbled on something that set her apart. "What is this?" she wondered, with a tilt of her hat. A hidden treasure box, sitting flat! 'Tap, tap', her fingers danced on the lid. What secrets inside were waiting to be hid? Flip! The lid popped open with a bang, zap, and zing! A swirling, twirling, time-traveling thing! The world around Una swirled like a top, and before she knew it, she came to a stop. The place was new, yet oddly familiar too. Flowers and trees, but everything was blue! 'Oh dear,' said Una, her heart did race, 'I'm back in time, what a curious place!'Along came a girl, tiny and bright, her giggles like stars that twinkled at night. A small child with eyes exactly the same, Una realized her mother was this girl's name! 'Hello!' said tiny mom, with a smile so wide, 'Will you be my friend? Let's run and slide!' They laughed and played, a wonderful dance, in a magical, whimsical, time-traveling chance. They picked a bouquet, flowers of whimsy, one smelled like chocolate, another like chim-chimney! 'Together we'll be forever friends. Even when this time-bending journey ends.'As the day grew longer, the sun began to set. Una knew she must go, her heart full of fret. 'But always remember,' said mom with a gleam, 'You're loved beyond this time, more than you dream!'With a blink and a shimmer, Una returned home, with a heart full of warmth from where she did roam. The treasure was gone, but its lesson remained: love and memories, forever ingrained. Every morning when the sun sets aglow, Una remembers the treasure of long ago. She smiles at the breeze and giggles with glee; time may change, but love is a timeless sea. And every treasure she finds, big or small, Una knows they have the power to magically enthrall. The end and the beginning are sometimes the same, as long as love is the center of the game.

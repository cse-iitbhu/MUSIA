Cody Cat has built himself an enormous Pixel Palace for all of his Code Cat friends! 
He made it the palace of his dreams. 
It has great big poles for scratching. 
It has goldfish ponds for watching the fish. 
But - UH OH!

Quick, Cody Cat, what's the problem? 
Well, the walls are all pixelated! They're glitching in a scrambly, blocky mess! 
So what are you going to do, Cody Cat? 
I'm going to code! 
How are you going to do it?

I'm going to say IF the walls are scrambled, THEN reorganise the pixels back into their original pattern. 
if (walls are scrambled) { reorganize pixels into original pattern; } 
Wow, Cody Cat! Now the Pixel Palace looks just like how you made it!

But... Cody Cat? 
Yeah? 
Have you noticed something...? 
What? 
Umm... the lights. Look at them. They're flickering on and off randomly. 
Oh no... 
What are you going to do, Cody Cat? 
I'm going to code! 
How are you going to do it?

I'm going to say IF the lights flicker, THEN set light timing to stable interval. 
if (lights flicker) { 
set light timing to stable 
interval; 
} 
Wow, Cody Cat! You sure fixed those lights! Nice and stable.

Now if you want to come with me, I'm going you our enormous ballroom... to show you 
Uh... Cody Cat? 
What? 
What are you doing? 
Nothing! Nothing... ahhh, well... 
Well, what? 
The door's not opening. 
The door's not opening? But I thought you made this palace! 
I did! I mean, I can fix it again... 
And how are you going to do that, Cody Cat? 
I'm going to code! 
How are you going to do it?

I'm going to say IF the door is stuck, THEN reset door mechanism. 
if (door is stuck) { 
reset door mechanism; 
} 
Wow, Cody Cat! Now it works! Nice and smooth!

So here is our amazing ballroom. I made the floor a beautiful green carpet, and the walls are purple, like my favourite flowers... 
Uhh... Cody Cat? 
What? 
The carpet in here is yellow? The walls are orange? 
Argh! They weren't like that before! 
So what are you going to do, Cody Cat? 
Well, I guess I'm going to code! 
How are you going to do it?

I'm going to say IF colors switched, THEN revert colors to original palette... 
if (colors switched) { revert colors to original palette; 
} 
Wow, Cody Cat! Those colours look great in here!

Now if you come into the kitchen, you'll see these great fish-shaped tiles I put on the floor... 
Just wait up, Cody Cat. 
What is it this time? 
Well... the floor has vanished here. And there! It's in patches! 
Oh no. 
So what are you going to do, Cody Cat? 
I'm just going to have to code! 
How are you going to do it?

I'm going to say IF floor is missing, THEN generate floor tiles. 
if (floor is missing) { generate floor tiles; 
} 
Wow, Cody Cat! Those fish tiles are really sigma! They make the floor look like a sea!

But hang on Cody. There's something weird about this kitchen... 
What? 
Well, the tables are floating in the air! 
And? 
The knives and forks are invisible! 
And? 
Well, do you think this is a good way for a kitchen to be? 
I guess not... 
So what are you going to do, Cody Cat? 
I'm going to code! 
How are you going to do it?

I'm going to say IF table levitates, THEN reset table to the ground. 
if (table levitates) { 
reset table to ground; 
} 
And IF utensils invisible, THEN make utensils visible. 
if (utensils invisible) { make utensils visible; 
} 
Wow, Cody Cat! It sure is nice to have a kitchen table to sit at, and a knife and fork to use, to eat this delicious pie you've cooked!

Yes, and if you look into this mirror... 
Uh oh. Where am I Cody? 
Umm... you're with me? 
And where are we? 
We seem to be on the stairs. 
How did we get here? 
I think we teleported here. I had this problem yesterday and forgot to fix it. The palace mirror teleports anyone who looks into it... did you look into it? 
Of course I did. You told me too. 
Skibidi. 
And why are these stairs just spiralling around and around forever in an endless loop? 
Well... I guess I don't know. 
So what are you going to do, Cody Cat? 
I'm going to code, of course! 
How are you going to do it?

I'm going to say IF stairs loop, THEN break loop and set end point. 
if (stairs loop) { 
break loop and set end point; 
} 
And I'm going to say IF mirror teleports, THEN disable teleportation function. 
if (mirror teleports) { 
disable teleportation function 
} 
Wow, Cody Cat! I've never been so happy to be back in a kitchen, rather than stuck in an endless stair loop!

So don't look at the mirror. Look over here, at the paintings in the lounge room. What do you think of those? 
I can't really tell, because the books are flying around. Look at them! They're spinning off the shelves! 
Argh rat whiskers. Alright, alright... 
So what are you going to do, Cody Cat? 
I'm going to code! 
How are you going to do it?
I'm going to say IF books are flying, THEN stop book movement. 
if (books are flying) { stop book movement 
} 
Wow, Cody Cat! The books have all stopped flying. But now they're all on the floor! 
Let's just put them back up ourselves. It's easier!

Oops! Is that the time? Cody Cat, I have to go home! Not that it hasn't been great seeing your Pixel Palace! 
You should be really proud of your... 
Uhhh... Cody Cat? 
Cody Cat? 
Why are we walking so fast out the door? 
It's like time is moving too fast in here! 
What's going on?

Sorry! I think time has glitched. I'll fix it! 
Here, watch this. 
if (time is unstable) { 
set time flow to normal speed 
}

Phew, Cody Cat! I'm glad to be back outside. 
You have fun with your Pixel Palace. I'll visit another time... 
NORMAL SPEED time, that is!

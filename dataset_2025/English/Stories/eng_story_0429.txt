In a dense forest, there lived a wise old owl. He lived in an old, hollow tree. Unlike other birds, he didn’t chirp much. Instead, he spent most of his time observing and thinking.

The other birds in the forest always seemed busy, chattering and arguing. They noticed the owl’s silence and thought he was strange. “Why don’t you speak?” they asked him.

The wise old owl replied, “I prefer to listen and observe. You can learn a lot more when you’re quiet.” The birds didn’t understand and continued with their noise.

One day, a big storm hit the forest. All the birds were scared and didn’t know what to do. They went to the wise old owl for advice. Calmly, the owl guided them to safety, using his knowledge gained from observing the weather patterns.

After the storm, the birds realized the owl’s wisdom. They understood the importance of being observant and thoughtful.

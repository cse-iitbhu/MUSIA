Hi, I am Anshu. It’s my birthday today. My mother baked a cake for
me. My father put balloons everywhere. My brother made a greeting
card. My grandfather, grandmother, uncle and aunt came for my birthday
party. My friends Aman, John, Priya, and Sania also came for the party. I
said, “Welcome”. We lighted candle. Then I cut the cake. All my friends
sang -
 “Happy Birthday to you...
 Happy Birthday to you...
 Happy Birthday dear Anshu
 May God bless you...
 Happy Birthday to you...”
They gave me gifts. Then we all ate cake, chocolates and laddoos. I
said, “Thank you”. We all enjoyed birthday party

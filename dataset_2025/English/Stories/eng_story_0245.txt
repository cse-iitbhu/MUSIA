
I am Freddie and I just learned something. No matter where you are:Look up. Look down. Look all around.
You never know what you may see. And it helps us be safe, yep-you and me.
Step one, step two, step three, and four. I walked into an open door.
I did not look right. But if I had. I would have seen Sally flying a kite with her dad.
Who looks left? What is there to see? Only a Circus Parade and a monkey in a tree.
I turned around and took one step. Into a puddle, and now I am wet.
Look up. Look down. Look all around. You will not miss a thing and be safe and sound.
